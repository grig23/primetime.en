# How to use Account IQ reports and dashboard {#how-to-aiq}

Let's understand how can we view and use various reports and statistics to analyze account sharing behavior.

## View account sharing reports {#view-reports}

To view reports in Account IQ, once you have successfully logged in to the application:

1. Select a report category (General Usage or Shared Accounts) under REPORTS from the navigation to the left.

1. Once you are on a reports category screen /page (either General Usage or Shared Accounts), you can filter the reports results for different sets of MVPDs and programmers, channels, and [time periods](/help/AccountIQ/product-concepts.md#time-frame) as discussed further.

1. From the filters panel at the top, use the drop-down options for **MVPDs in segment**, **Channels in Segment**, and [time period](/help/AccountIQ/product-concepts.md#time-frame) selector from **Granularity and time frame**.
