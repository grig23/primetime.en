# View account sharing reports: for a specific MVPD <!--and programmer--> {#report-sp-mvpd}

If you are a [programmer](/help/AccountIQ/product-concepts.md#programmer-def), you can view sharing reports of your channel viewers for the specific [MVPD](/help/AccountIQ/product-concepts.md#mvpd-def) they have subscribed to.

To view reports in Account IQ, once you have successfully logged in to the application as a programmer:

1. Go to segment panel at the top of the application.

   1. From the **MVPDs in segment** option, deselect **All**. Doing this enables the selection of individual MVPDs.

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >By default, all the MVPDs (that aggregate your channels) are selected.

   1. In the **Channels in segment** drop-down, deselect **All** to enable the selection for individual programmers and channels.

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >The top level checkboxes are programmers and the next level checkboxes are their channels.

    1. From the **Granularity and time frame** option, select the time interval to view reports. You can aggregate the time intervals week-wise or month-wise.
