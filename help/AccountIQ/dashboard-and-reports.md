# The dashboard and reports {#dashboard- and-reports}

Account IQ helps MVPDs and programmers understand the risks to their revenue and business operations, and determine the most effective actions to take to mitigate the impacts of credential fraud. It helps MVPDs and programmers uncover password sharing with a high level of confidence, enabling them deliver better business outcomes and provide better viewing experiences for subscribers.
To help MVPDs and programmers better understand password sharing within their businesses, Primetime Account IQ determines a password sharing risk index that rates every subscriber on their likelihood of sharing account credentials for subscription passwords, from very low to very high.
