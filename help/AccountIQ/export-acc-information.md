# Export information for accounts with high sharing score {#export-account-info-high-score}

Account IQ gives you the option to export account sharing details for top 1000 subscriber accounts based on their [sharing probabilities](/help/AccountIQ/product-concepts.md#account-sharing-probability-def). The data in the exported CSV file is sorted in the decreasing order of the sharing probabilities of the subscriber accountsâ€”of the selected MVPDs in the [segment](/help/AccountIQ/product-concepts.md#segment-def), for a [specified time frame](/help/AccountIQ/product-concepts.md#time-frame-def).

The option to export the account sharing information is available on [General Usage Reports](/help/AccountIQ/general-usage-reports.md) and [Shared Accounts Reports](/help/AccountIQ/shared-acc-reports.md) pages.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The numbers in the downloaded CSV file are different for General Usage and Shared Accounts reports pages. This is because the General Usage Reports page has additional filters for the programmers to select Threshold for number of devices, IPs and Zip codes. So the data exported from General Usage reports is based on the additional threshold filter applied.

To export the account sharing information of subscribers:

1. Specify a segment from the segment selector. To select a segment:

   1. Select the desired MVPDs from **MVPDs in segment** option.

   1. Select the desired Channels from **Channels in segment** option.

   1. Select a timeframe from **Granularity and time frame** option to view reports for that.

1. Select the **Export top 1000 accounts** option to export the account information for 1000 subscribers with highest sharing probability.

When you use the export option, the statistics for 1000 accounts with the highest sharing probabilities (for a defined time frame) are downloaded to the Downloads folder of your local machine.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The downloaded CSV file can be opened using any application that reads CSV file, for example Microsoft Excel.

## Columns in the exported report {#columns-in-export}

**Week/ Month**

The week or the month, which you selected on the **Granularity and Time Frame** option in the segment selector, for which the sharing statistics are sought.

**MVPD**

If you are a programmer user, the column shows which MVPD does the subscriber account belong to.

**Subscriber Id**

Specific account which we are talking about in a row.

**Minimum # Devices**

The actual number of devices (that stream content) is almost certainly greater than the minimum number of devices, specified for a particular account.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The actual number of devices (that stream content) is certainly greater than the Minimum # of devices, specified for a particular account.

**Minimum # Persons**

The absolute minimum number of people that were active streaming content using those devices.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The actual number of persons (that stream content) is almost certainly much greater than the Minimum # of persons, specified for a particular account.

**# IPs**

Number of IP addresses from which content is streamed.

**# Locations**

Number of locations (based on zip code) from which content is streamed.

**# Cities**

Number of cities where the streaming has taken place.

**# States**

Number of states where the streaming has taken place.

**# Clusters**

The number of distinct [clusters](/help/AccountIQ/product-concepts.md#cluster-def) where streaming has taken place.

**Geographic span (miles)**

The maximum distance between the streaming locations associated with the account.

**# AuthN OK**

The number of times that the users have logged-in during the period, using that account.

**# AuthZ OK**

Number of times an MVPD has authorized a stream, or granted access (to content), to that account.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The **# AuthZ OK** is related to the **# Play Requests**; it is smaller than the **# Play Requests** because Adobe caches the authorizations that come for MVPDs typically for 24 hours.

**# Play Requests**

The actual number of streams during the time period.

**# Channels**

Total number of different channels that the account has watched over the time period.

>[!NOTE]
>
>**# Channels** includes the channels that not necessarily belonged to the logged-in programmer.
>
>This number for the account showed up because the account watched your channel, but it also accessed other channels during that time period.

**Usage Pattern**

The numbers in this column are identifiers that map to one of the 14 patterns that we identify all the user accounts as.

*Table: Usage pattern identifiers in exported CSV mapping with usage patterns*

 | ID | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 and 8 | 6 | 7 | 9 | 10 and 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 |
 |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
 | Usage Patterns | Regular user | Traveler or commuter | Large family | Close family and friends | Social group sharing | Large group of friends | Concurrent streaming | Community sharing | Uncertain behavior | Small family | Second home | Abnormal Usage |

**Sharing Probability**

Sharing probability is the probability that the specific account is sharing its credentials.

>[!NOTE]
>
> The average of the sharing probability of all the accounts (in the selected segment) is used to compute the [sharing level](/help/AccountIQ/dashboard.md#sharing-level) of the [Aggregated sharing score](/help/AccountIQ/dashboard.md#aggregated-sharing).
