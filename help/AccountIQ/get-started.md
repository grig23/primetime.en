## How to onboard organizations on Account IQ? {#steps-to-onboard}

This is what we have at the moment. The plan is to get rid of dma_primetime check and have a dedicated profile for AIQ. The users who need to have access to the console would need that user profile. This is however not implemented at the moment.

1. Onboard the organization in Adobe Experience Cloud<!-- Marketing cloud as of now-->.

2. Assign `TVE Dashboard Read-Write` and `TVE Dashboard Read Only` profiles to your organization users in [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/).

3. Whitelist the Organization IDs on Account IQ.
