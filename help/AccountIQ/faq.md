# Frequently asked questions {#faqs}

1. Who is Account IQ designed for?

   **Answer.** Account IQ is designed to serve Programmers, MVPDs, and D2C services, however there are minor differences between these two versions. There are limitations and restrictions on what data can be showed to each group.

1. How far back does the data go?

   **Answer.** Two years. Data retention policies prevent keeping data older than that.

1. How often is the data updated?

   **Answer.** The data in Account IQ is updated on weekly and monthly basis.

1. Is it possible to filter out the test accounts?

   **Answer.** The functionality to filter out the test accounts is not available in this version, but the feature will be available in a future release.

1. Can I see the account sharing for each of my channels?

   **Answer.** Yes, you can see account sharing for individual channels, a group of channels, or entire networks (for example, programmers).

1. What is the data source used to identify credential sharing?

   **Answer.** The service examines all of the subscriber streaming activity and enhances it with proprietary data sources. For TV Everywhere this includes all transactions between programmers and MVPDs. From there, higher level analytics data of account sharing scores is synthesized.

1. What is the industry average?

   **Answer.** Industry average is reflected in the three primary sharing indicators—Sharing level, Usage from shared accounts, and Overall sharing score. These values represent the averages of all subscribers for all services.

1. Is AccountIQ an enforcement tool? If not, how do we use it to stop sharing?

   **Answer.** AIQ uses powerful analytics to provide insights. However, those insights can drive unlimited actions though integrations with Adobe products, such as Concurrency Monitoring, or your enterprise tools.

1. How effective is Concurrency Monitoring in mitigating sharing in industry?

   **Answer.** Account IQ and Concurrency Monitoring detect different modes of sharing and are complimentary. CM is excellent at preventing sharing that occurs simultaneously. It's therefore most effective during primetime viewing or for live events, such as sports. On the other hand, Account IQ looks at a broad set of historical data and therefore detects sharing that is not necessarily simultaneous. These two services can be combined for even more effective solution.  

1. Can we identify particular accounts?

   **Answer.** Yes, we can provide the list of Accounts from any segment along with their sharing metrics and characteristics.

1. How similar are Account IQ’s results compare to in-house solutions?

   **Answer.** Account IQ has access to more data than any single streaming service and has a detection model based on over a decade of processing, which results in the most accurate results available.

1. How can I use the insights provided by Account IQ?

   **Answer.** Understanding the scale and nature of sharing is the first step in our recommended best practices. Taking targeted action with specific accounts such as upselling or limiting streams is the step. The full recommendation is to start small, measure the results of the action, and refine and scale the process.

1. Do we need to work with internal technology groups and distribution partners to implement measures like smart CM?

   **Answer.** Not necessarily, Adobe Primetime Support can work with to create your own CM rules based on AIQ your data.

1. Can I see how segments trend over time?

   **Answer.** Yes, operation impact graphs track and display characteristics of a target segment over the life of the operation.
