# Operations {#operations-tab-next-steps}

Apart from viewing reports and analytics for subscriber accounts, Account IQ also gives you functionality to perform bulk tasks and automations on subscriber accounts, to mitigate and check password sharing. The operations in Account IQ help in creating, scheduling, managing, and recording the effects of these bulk tasks.

The **Operations** page opens on selecting **Operations** tab under **Actions**, in left navigation pane of Account IQ. This page lists all the existing operations and their details.
