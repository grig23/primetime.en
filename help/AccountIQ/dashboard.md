The Dashboard summarizes and aggregates data in a collection of graphs and reports designed to provide a high level insight into the scope and impact of account sharing.

## Aggregated Sharing Score {#aggregated-sharing}

The Aggregated Sharing Score panel provides a top line readout summarizing the quantity and impact of sharing in terms of accounts and streaming volume.

Also known as Aggregated Risk Index or Risk Index and Sharing Risk Index, it is a value that helps you understand the magnitude of password sharing by your subscribers, hence providing you a sense of urgency to act upon it.

The following three metrics contribute to the Aggregate Sharing Score.

### Sharing level {#sharing-level}

The sharing level gauge shows the percentage of all your subscriber accounts that are shared, during the selected time frame.  

A value calculated based on an average of the sharing probability computed for every account in the set of selected MVPDs that has streamed from a one of the selected Programmer Channels during the selected time frame.

The Trend indicator shows the change in   

**Usage from shared accounts**


**Overall sharing score**


### MVPDs in segment {#mvpd-in-segment}

It is a table of risk indices and accounts totals for the top MVPDs ranked by overall usage or account sharing.
