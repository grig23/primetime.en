# The dashboard {#dashboard}

The Dashboard summarizes and aggregates data in a collection of graphs and reports designed to give a high level overview of the scope and impact of account sharing. It provides a single page containing the major reports and metrics from Account IQ.

## Aggregated Sharing Score {#aggregated-sharing}

The Aggregated Sharing Score panel provides a top line readout summarizing the quantity and impact of sharing in terms of accounts and streaming volume.

Also known as Aggregated Risk Index or Risk Index and Sharing Risk Index, it is a value that helps you understand the magnitude of password sharing by your subscribers, hence providing you a sense of urgency to act upon it.

The following three metrics contribute to the Aggregate Sharing Score.

### Sharing level {#sharing-level}

The sharing level gauge shows the percentage of all your subscriber accounts (in the defined segment) that are shared, during the selected time frame.  

A value calculated based on an average of the sharing probability computed for every account in the set of selected MVPDs that has streamed from a one of the selected Programmer Channels during the selected time frame.

The Trend indicator shows the percentage change in the value of the metric in from the previous time frame.

**Usage from shared accounts**

This gauge informs that what percent of the usage of all the subscriber accounts is from the shared accounts, in the defined segment in a time period. The gauge marks the ranges of usage (from shared accounts) on the scale of 0 to 100%. These ranges—named Low, Medium, High, and Abnormal—are based on the industry average.

You can also see the Trend indicator, which depicts a dip or plunge in the usage from shared accounts as compared to the previous time frame.

### Sharing score by channels and MVPDs {#sharin-score-by-channels-and-mvpds}

It is the table of overall sharing score of each channel in the segment for top MVPDs.

### Accounts sharing probability {#accounts-sharing-probability}

It partitions accounts into ranges of sharing probability from very low to very high.

### Number of accounts and usage by sharing probability level {#number-of-accounts-usage-sharing-probability}

Shows account totals, usage, and trends for accounts partitioned into ranges of sharing probability of very low to very high.
