TV Everywhere not only delivers comfortable and engaging experiences to viewers, but also lets content providers reach their customers and earn great advertising revenues. However, this evolution in TV viewing is accompanied with the problem of account sharing.

As passwords are the main methods for the viewers to authenticate, there is a misconception that credential sharing is allowed. This idea makes illicit password sharing a common practice. This account sharing results in lost revenue for MVPDs and programmers, thereby necessitating the need to educate their viewers about permissible sharing and preventing illicit sharing.

Primetime Account IQ helps MVPDs and programmers identify account sharing with confidence. It provides them with analytics data and assigns sharing scores to different accounts, so that these companies can take informed decisions about their accounts and check the illicit sharing.
