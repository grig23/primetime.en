# Account IQ overview {#account-iq-overview}

TV Everywhere not only delivers comfortable and engaging experiences to viewers, but also lets content providers reach their customers and earn advertising revenues. However, this evolution in TV viewing is accompanied with the problem of account sharing; thereby resulting in lost revenue for Pay TV Providers (MVPDs) and programmers. Account IQ is a hosted web application that offers a solution to this problem, by providing the media companies with analytics data about account sharing behaviors.

Account IQ sits at the transaction between subscribers and content providers, to analyze the user behavior.

The tool assigns sharing scores to different subscriber accounts, so that the content providers (media companies, programmers, and MVPDs) can take informed decisions about subscriber accounts and check the illicit sharing.

Passwords are the main methods for viewers to authenticate, and there is a misconception that credential sharing is allowed. This idea makes illicit password sharing a common practice; necessitating the need for media companies to educate their viewers about permissible sharing and prevent illicit sharing.
