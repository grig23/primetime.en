# Account IQ overview {#account-iq-overview}

TV Everywhere not only delivers comfortable and engaging experiences to viewers, but also lets content providers reach their customers and earn great advertising revenues. However, this evolution in TV viewing is accompanied with the problem of account sharing.

As passwords are the main methods for the viewers to authenticate, there is a misconception that credential sharing is allowed. This idea makes illicit password sharing a common practice.
