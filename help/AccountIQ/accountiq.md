# The Account IQ {#aiq-tool}

Account IQ helps MVPDs and programmers understand the risks to their revenue and business operations, and determine the most effective actions to take to mitigate the impacts of credential fraud. It helps MVPDs and programmers uncover password sharing with a high level of confidence, enabling them deliver better business outcomes and provide better viewing experiences for subscribers.

To help MVPDs and programmers better understand password sharing within their businesses, Primetime Account IQ determines a Password Sharing Risk Index that rates every subscriber on their likelihood of sharing account credentials for subscription passwords, from very low to very high. Based on these calculations and the resulting indices, analytics are performed and visuals are generated for better understanding and interpretation of the account sharing behavior. Account IQ is a hosted web application/ tool, which you can access using your browser. It has the following screens/ pages/sections:

* [Dashboard home](/help/AccountIQ/dashboard.md)
* [General Usage reports](/help/AccountIQ/reports.md#general-usage)
* [Shared Accounts reports](/help/AccountIQ/reports.md#shared-accounts)
* [Usage Patterns](/help/AccountIQ/usage-patterns.md)

Let's take a deep dive into each of these analytics and reports. Note that there is a panel at the top of all the screens to select the companies (MVPDs and respective programmers) and a time frame to filter your results for viewing the sharing behavior.
