# Best Practices {#aiq-best-practices}

## Analyse and understand {#analyse-understand}

* Understand nature and impact of sharing on your business
* Access all relevant data
Analyze sharing in the context of your objectives
* Identify patterns and behavior to target

## Incremental targeted action {#incremental-targeted-action}

* Take incremental targeted action based on new level of understanding
* Align enterprise stakeholders to update strategy
* Revisit partner agreements to enlist cooperation or concessions
* Target users likely to respond to offers to upgrade, pay for sharing, etc.
* Mitigate sharing limiting access to obvious moochers
* Simplify access and enhance the user experience for good customers

## Track and measure impact {#track-measure-impact}

Measure the effect of actions taken[CF1]

## Improve and repeat {#improve-repeat}

Repeat[CF2]


we can show why and how the tracking can help . this phrase is just a repetition of the title. we can say what customer can expect to experience and how tracking will solve this  [CF1]
same as for the previous comment - why is repeating important? in which way? we can use a relaxed/informal tone, as opposed to the business one.  [CF2]
For example here we can provide details about the updated strategies and tactics - see this example from Cartesian - We help providers thoughtfully mitigate credential sharing in three ways:
Proactive notifications
We work with providers to design, implement, and monitor tactics well established in other fields. One example is sending email notifications to accounts with suspicious usage patterns when a new device signs into the account. This improves account security, as subscribers who are unaware that a new device signed into their account can proactively reset their passwords. Subscribers who are intentionally sharing credentials are subtly reminded that their devices are being monitored, which may encourage them to reduce sharing.
Targeted and escalating friction
For more severe cases where notifications have little effect, we help deploy incremental responses with escalating user friction (e.g., signing out users, or requiring them to reset their password). This approach can target a select group of accounts with a long history of credential sharing patterns while also preserving a great user experience for customers who abide by the terms of service.
Incentives to sign-up
We help providers target non-paying users with high propensity to sign-up and provide them incentives (e.g. referral discount / free trial) to subscribe. This approach can help convert highly engaged users into paying subscribers in a cost-effective way, without affecting the experience for the main account holder.<>
