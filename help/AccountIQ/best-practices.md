# Best Practices {#aiq-best-practices}

Account IQ enables you to identify credential sharing, measure its scope and impact, segment relevant cohorts, and track the effect of targeted actions. It offers a variety of tools, charts and reports used to understand and manage shared accounts that can be used in any number of ways. Each streaming service approaches this behavior and develops processes that match their unique goals, and the product is designed to flexibly meet those needs.  However, there are some rules of general practices that can be applied to a broad set of scenarios.

## Analyze and understand {#analyze-understand}

Account IQ tools assist in understanding the nature and breadth of credential sharing on your business, from the highest-level charts that display the percentage of shared accounts to the lowest level exports that report the characteristics of individual accounts. Especially at the outset, use these tools to explore the data and identify unusual or interesting cohorts or behavioral patterns – indicating high levels of sharing for example. Then, segments representing a particular opportunity or objective can be identified.

To understand nature and impact of sharing on your business:

* Start by reviewing any and all potentially relevant data.

* Identify and analyze sharing in the context of your objectives.

* Identify patterns and behavior to target.

## Take targeted incremental action {#incremental-targeted-action}

With a defined target segment, take action. By starting small with a well-defined segment, you lower your risk of unintentional consequences and can better understand the outcome. No matter where you are along your path, you can always refine or expand the target of your operation.
To start small and ramp up is a prudent approach. Use previously identified segments and take actions (as experiments) with specific objectives.

Use the Operation tool to define the target segment and an operational time frame. This will allow you to track effects in the next phase.

* Identify a well-defined, representative set (or subset) of users to act on.

* Create an operation that defines the target segment and operation timeframe.

* Depending on objectives such as upselling, increasing ad load, or mitigating access to fraudulent accounts, take relevant actions on the defined user set, such as: in app offers, extra ads, or requiring multi-factor authentication.

<!--If necessary, gauge the affect [by measuring the impact of actions taken](#track-measure-impact).-->

## Track and measure the impact of actions {#track-measure-impact}

Actions require time to take effect. Use the operation and associated charts to track the operation state and segment characteristics throughout subsequent weeks or months of the operation time frame. Combine this information with any other analytics to answer or understand the outcome. For example: What percentage of borrowers converted to subscribers? How many additional ads were viewed? Did the number of borrowers decrease?

* Use operation charts and other analytics to track and measure the effect of actions.

## Improve and repeat {#improve-repeat}

Based on the outcomes of your experiments and targeted actions a set of users, you can expand the reach of your strategies to a larger set of users or adjust or reset the approach.

* If the results of the experiment are favorable, then you can scale up the experiment or action, and repeat those actions on a larger group.

* If the results of the experiment are unfavorable, then you can adjust your action or the segment.

Best Practices
Account IQ enables you to maximize your business ROI, and eventually grow your subscribers and revenue by understanding subscriber usage patterns and password sharing. Read on to know how you can make the best use of Account IQ to manage credential sharing.

Analyze and understand
Authorized access of streaming services generates vast sums of data representing user activity. Use Account IQ analytics tools to explore the data and identify interesting cohorts or behavioral patterns that indicate sharing. Then, segments representing a particular opportunity or objective can be identified.

To understand nature and impact of sharing on your business:

Use Account IQ to access all relevant data.

Identify and analyze sharing in the context of your objectives.

Identify patterns and behavior to target.

Take targeted incremental action
To start small and ramp up is a prudent approach. Use previously identified segments, and take actions (as experiments) with specific objectives.

Identify a well-defined, representative subset of users in the segment to act on.

Depending on objectives such as upselling, increasing ad load, or mitigating access to fraudulent accounts, take relevant actions to include customer messaging or offers, extra ads, or requiring multi-factor authentication.

Target users are likely to respond to offers to upgrade and pay for sharing.

Align enterprise stakeholders to update strategy, such as:

Revisit partner agreements to enlist cooperation or concessions.

Simplify access and enhance the user experience for good customers.

Mitigate sharing by limiting access to obvious moochers.

If necessary, gauge the affect by measuring the impact of actions taken.

Track and measure the impact of actions
Once you have acted on some set of users within a segment, it is important to measure the effect of those actions over a subsequent period of weeks or months. For example, you would want to understand:

What percentage of borrowers converted to subscribers?

How many additional ads were viewed?

Did the number of borrowers decrease?

Account IQ’s sophisticated machine learning based models help you analyze and measure the impacts of your experiments (or actions).

Improve and repeat
Based on the outcomes of your experiments and targeted actions on small groups of users, you can expand the reach of your strategies to rest of the user segment or reset the strategy and audience to act on.

Based on the usage insights from risk indices, sharing levels, and usage patterns, you can create experiments (or operations) and tailor your actions for strategic goals or desired outcomes.

If the results of the experiment are favorable, then you can scale up the experiment, and repeat those actions on a larger group.

If the results of the experiment are unfavorable, then you can adjust your action or the experiment group.

Therefore, understanding, acting, and tracking are the keys to optimally mitigate and manage credential sharing in your subscribers.
