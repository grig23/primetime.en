# Best Practices {#aiq-best-practices}

Account IQ enables you to maximize your business ROI, and eventually grow your subscribers and revenue by understanding subscriber usage patterns and password sharing. Read on to know how you can make the best use of Account IQ to manage credential sharing.

## Analyze and understand {#analyze-understand}

Authorized access of streaming services generates vast sums of data representing user activity. Use the Account IQ analytics tools to explore the data and identify interesting cohorts or behavioral patterns that indicate sharing. Then, segments representing a particular opportunity or objective can be identified.

To understand nature and impact of sharing on your business:

* Use Account IQ to access all relevant data.

* Identify and analyze sharing in the context of your objectives.

* Identify patterns and behavior to target.

## Take targeted incremental action {#incremental-targeted-action}

To start small and ramp up is a prudent approach. Use previously identified segments, and take actions (as experiments) with specific objectives.

* Identify a well-defined, representative subset of users in the segment to act on.

* Depending on objectives such as upselling, increasing ad load, or mitigating access to fraudulent accounts, take relevant actions to include customer messaging or offers, extra ads, or requiring multi-factor authentication.

* Target users are likely to respond to offers to upgrade and pay for sharing.

* Align enterprise stakeholders to update strategy, such as:

  * Revisit partner agreements to enlist cooperation or concessions.

  * Simplify access and enhance the user experience for good customers.
  
  * Mitigate sharing by limiting access to obvious moochers.

* If necessary, gauge the affect [by measuring the impact of actions taken](#track-measure-impact).

## Track and measure the impact of actions {#track-measure-impact}

Once you have acted on some set of users within a segment, it is important to measure the effect of those actions over a subsequent period of weeks or months. For example, you would want to understand:

* What percentage of borrowers converted to subscribers?

* How many additional ads were viewed?

* Did the number of borrowers decrease?

Account IQ's sophisticated machine learning based models help you analyze and measure the impacts of your experiments (or actions).

## Improve and repeat {#improve-repeat}

Based on the outcomes of your experiments and targeted actions on small groups of users, you can expand the reach of your strategies to rest of the user segment or reset the strategy and audience to act on.

* Based on the usage insights from risk indices, sharing levels, and usage patterns, you can create experiments (or operations) and tailor your actions for strategic goals or desired outcomes.

* If the results of the experiment are favorable, then you can scale up the experiment, and repeat those actions on a larger group.

* If the results of the experiment are unfavorable, then you can adjust your action or the experiment group.

Therefore, understanding, acting, and tracking are the keys to optimally mitigate and manage credential sharing in your subscribers.

<!--For example here we can provide details about the updated strategies and tactics - see this example from Cartesian - We help providers thoughtfully mitigate credential sharing in three ways:

Proactive notifications
We work with providers to design, implement, and monitor tactics well established in other fields. One example is sending email notifications to accounts with suspicious usage patterns when a new device signs into the account. This improves account security, as subscribers who are unaware that a new device signed into their account can proactively reset their passwords. Subscribers who are intentionally sharing credentials are subtly reminded that their devices are being monitored, which may encourage them to reduce sharing.

Targeted and escalating friction
For more severe cases where notifications have little effect, we help deploy incremental responses with escalating user friction (e.g., signing out users, or requiring them to reset their password). This approach can target a select group of accounts with a long history of credential sharing patterns while also preserving a great user experience for customers who abide by the terms of service.

Incentives to sign-up
We help providers target non-paying users with high propensity to sign-up and provide them incentives (e.g. referral discount / free trial) to subscribe. This approach can help convert highly engaged users into paying subscribers in a cost-effective way, without affecting the experience for the main account holder.-->
