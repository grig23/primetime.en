# How to view reports for top 10 MVPDs {#view-top-10-mvpd-reports}

Account IQ has capabilities to make you view and analyze account sharing statistics for top 10 of your MVPDs (in a defined [segment](/help/AccountIQ/product-concepts.md#segmet-def)) having:

* highest percentage of subscribers that are sharing accounts

* subscribers with maximum usage from shared accounts

* subscribers with highest magnitude (overall sharing score) of password sharing

>[!NOTE]
>
>The basis of calculations, to obtain the list of top MVPDs from a segment, is the data of the entire video streaming industry and not just a specific programmer's MVPD.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Only the MVPDs that have a minimum of 50,000 active subscriber accounts are considered to obtain these reports.

For a logged-in programmer user, following three default selections (to view reports of top ten MVPDs) are available:

* [Top 10 MVPDs by sharing score](#top-10mvpds-sharingscore)

* [Top 10 MVPDs by usage](#top-10mvpds-usage)

* [Top 10 MVPDs by accounts](#top-10mvpds-accounts)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>If you select the MVPDs individually to define the segment, then you can select at most 10 MVPDs to view sharing statistics.

When you use the selection **top 10 MVPDs by sharing score** to define your segment, then the Account IQ system identifies 10 MVPDs from across the industry to  a list of the  lists at most ten MVPDs (along with their corresponding metrics) in the descending order of their [overall sharing score](/help/AccountIQ/product-concepts.md#overall-sharing-score)

To view the list and reports for top ten MVPDs by sharing score for your channel:
