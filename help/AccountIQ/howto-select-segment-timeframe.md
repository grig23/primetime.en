At the top of all the reports pages on Account IQ, there is a panel to define segment by selecting MVPDs, channel programmers, and granularity and time frame.

### Select MVPDs in segment {#select-segment-mvpds}
To select MVPDs from **MVPDs in segment** option:
1. Select the **MVPDs in segment** dropdown option.
   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >**All** industry MVPDs are selected by default. From here, you can select either of the **Top 10 MVPDs by sharing score**, **Top 10 MVPDs by usage**, **Top 10 MVPDs by accounts**. or individual MVPDs. However, to select individual MVPDs you need to deselect **All**.
1. Select the desired MVPDs.
    You can remove an MVPD from the selection by deselecting it.
1. Select **Apply selection** for your selection to take effect. Otherwise, you will loose your selection.
