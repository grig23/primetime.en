# Usage Patterns {#usage-patterns}

Account IQ classifies users of subscriber accounts into various categories in terms of their social behavior. The **Usage Patterns** page shows analytics and reports for these user typologies. For example, **Usage patterns distribution - Users in segment vs industry** report compares the usage behavior of different user categories in a segment with the user categories in entire industry.

Once you define a segment by selecting MVPDs, Channels, and time frame from the [segment panel](/help/AccountIQ/segments-timeframe.md), the reports are generated on this page for various user types based on their viewing behavior.

The [!UICONTROL Usage Patterns] page has graphs that give you insights into account sharing and usage for different user typology or characteristics. Here, metrics extracted from the Reports are used to calculate risk indices. These are plotted on graph and are used to compare behavior of different user segments and also with the industry.

## Usage patterns distribution {#usage-pattern-dis}

The bar graph in **Usage patterns distribution- Users in segment vs industry** depicts number and percentages of unique visitors of various user typographies (based on usage behaviors). It also compares these numbers for the selected segment with those of the industry. It also tells what percentage of the the viewers are unique visitors of all the channels.

## Usage pattern distribution in segment (#usage-pattern-dis-segment)

The **Usage patterns distribution in segment** panel tabulates the following information user behavior wise:

* Sharing probability range that the individual accounts fall into
* Number of accounts in that category
* Usage in terms of play requests

For example, in the above image:

* A regular user (one person or a family streaming at home on the same devices) in the defined segment has the account sharing probability between 0 to 5%.

* And 36.8% (2,201,935) of the total subscriber accounts (5,981,648) are regular users.

* And 15.7% (24,073,311) of the total play requests (153,076,350) are made by regular users.
