# Known issues and limitations {#known-issues}

Adobe strives to offer robust functionality and seamless user experiences through its offerings. The current version (version 1.0) of Account IQ provides usage and subscription sharing analytics to streaming providers with high degree of confidence. However, following limitations will be addressed in upcoming release versions.

* When you are defining a new [segment](/help/AccountIQ/segments-timeframe.md) for an operation you can add metrics. However,  there isn't an option to specify and add more metrics, as of now, to refine these cohorts or segments.

* When estimating sharing scores for individual accounts, Adobe enables companies to act on sharing with great degree of confidence. However, the Account IQ underestimates the total amount of sharing when trying to pull other industry averages.

* When calculating [Overall Sharing Score](/help/AccountIQ/dashboard.md#overall-sharing-score), additional metrics can be factored in— along with [Sharing Level](/help/AccountIQ/dashboard.md#sharing-level) and [Usage from Shared Accounts](/help/AccountIQ/dashboard.md#usage-from-shared-accounts).

* When defining cohorts, the selectors for MVPDs and channels lack the search mechanism, as of now.

* When defining cohorts, there is a limitation to select only up to 10 MVPDs and Programmers.

* The option to export account statistics is limited to export 1000 accounts, as of now.

* The option to select [Segment Type](#segment-type) when defining Operations is limited to **Fixed number of accounts**, and **Variable number of accounts** option will be available in forthcoming versions.

* The functionalities—Benchmarking, Detection Models, Segments, Snapshots, and Rules in the left navigation will be available in the forthcoming versions.

* The option to export statistics for Usage Pattern page will be available in forthcoming releases.

* When creating [Operations](/help/AccountIQ/operation-affecting-user-segment.md), you can identify only two kinds of [Actions](/help/AccountIQ/operation-affecting-user-segment.md) as of now.

* You can only [schedule](/help/AccountIQ/operation-affecting-user-segment.md#action) operations for a later date, and there is a limit to start and stop the operation.

* The Isolation mode does not truly reflect the amount of sharing. Therefore, MVPD in Isolation mode cannot be compared to any other MVPD.

* When you are defining a new [segment](/help/AccountIQ/segments-timeframe.md) for an operation you can add metrics. However,  there isn't an option to specify and add more metrics, as of now, to refine these cohorts or segments.
