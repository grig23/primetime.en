Account IQ being a robust and scalable analytics tool enables you to view, analyze, and compare subscriber accounts sharing statistics not only for one, two, or three but for more MVPDs at a given time.

>However, as of now you can select at most 10 individual MVPDs from the segment and time frame panel to view subscriber sharing statistics.

To view subscriber account sharing statistics for multiple MVPDs:

1. Define a desired segment following the steps in [How to define segment and select timeframe](/help/AccountIQ/howto-select-segment-timeframe.md) for evaluation from [segment and timeframe panel](/help/AccountIQ/segments-timeframe.md).

1. Select a desired reports page from the left navigation:
