# Building the Packager Server and AIR Application {#building-the-packager-server-and-air-application}

There are two components required to use the Flash Access Manager:

* The Flash Access Manager AIR application 
* The Packager Server ( [!DNL flashaccess-packager.war])

Both components are distributed in both source and binary forms with the Reference Implementation.
