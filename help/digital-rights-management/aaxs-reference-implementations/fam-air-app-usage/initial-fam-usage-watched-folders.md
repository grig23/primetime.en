# Watched Folders {#watched-folders}

You can use Watched Folders to automatically package content created in certain folders. Each Watched Folder can be configured with different packaging options. To test packaging options before creating a Watched Folder, use the Package Media tab.

To create a Watched Folder, click **[!UICONTROL Add New Watched Folder]** and fill in the packaging options. See the [Packaging media files](../../aaxs-protecting-content/content-packaging-media-files/content-packaging-media-files-overview.md) section for a description of each option. When done, click **[!UICONTROL Save Watched Folder Properties]**.

When a Watched Folder is saved, the packaging options are saved to *[Input Folder]* [!DNL \properties\watchfolder.properties]. Any content added to the Input Folder which meets the Input Media File Selection criteria will automatically be packaged and placed in the Output Folder. See the Global Watched Folder Preferences in the section [Packager Preferences](../../aaxs-reference-implementations/fam-air-app-usage/initial-fam-setup-set-prefs/initial-fam-setup-pkg-prefs.md) to configure additional Watched Folder options.

To modify Watched Folder settings, select the Watched Folder input path from the list at the top of the screen. Modify the settings and click **[!UICONTROL Save Watched Folder Properties]**.

To delete a Watched Folder, select the Watched Folder input path from the list at the top of the screen and click **[!UICONTROL Delete Watched Folder Properties]**.
