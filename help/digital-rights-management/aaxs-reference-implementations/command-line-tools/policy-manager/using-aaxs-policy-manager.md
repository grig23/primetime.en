# Using Policy Manager {#using-policy-manager}

Using Policy Manager, you can create and manage policies. Before you run Policy Manager, optionally set values for Policy Manager properties in the configuration file. The configuration file specifies information that will be applied to all policies. All Policy Manager properties may also be specified on the command line.
