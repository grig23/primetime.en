# Overview {#primetime-drm-cloud-quick-start-overview}

Work with your Adobe representative to obtain certificates, and to set up an administrative account at ExpressPlay. After your Adobe and ExpressPlay accounts are set up, you can begin to implement and test workflows for different DRM solutions.

These quick-start steps assist you through the Multi-DRM setup process; from acquiring the required certs and keys, to getting an admin account at ExpressPlay, to testing packaging, licensing, and playback of your protected content.
