# Typical workflow{#typical-workflow}

This is a typical Primetime DRM reference implementations workflow that features both the command-line tools and the license server:

1. Create a DRM policy using the Policy command-line tool. 
1. Encrypt content using the Packager command-line tool. 
1. Deploy the reference implementations license server. 
1. Upload a video player to a web server. 
1. Use the uploaded video player to acquire a license and play your encrypted content.

As this typical workflow uses both the command-line tools and the license server, you will want to install and configure both of those components before you proceed.
