# What is NOT supported by Primetime Cloud DRM{#what-is-not-supported-by-primetime-cloud-drm}

Primetime Cloud DRM supports nearly all of the features currently available with Primetime DRM. However, due to some of the DRM features requiring communication with a customer's back-end business rules subsystem, some features are not available with Primetime Cloud DRM.

The features currently not supported by Primetime Cloud DRM are:

* Content packaged with an External CEK (where the license server requests the content's CEK from an external key management system) 
* Device Domains 
* Advanced License Chaining 
* License Return/Revocation 
* PHLS/PHDS. These are protection schemes that do not make use of a License Server 
* User / password authentication
