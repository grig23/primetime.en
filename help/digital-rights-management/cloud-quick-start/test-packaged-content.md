# Test the packaged content {#test-the-packaged-content}

You should validate that the packaging operation succeeded by using the publicly-available Adobe Primetime Desktop Player (via Flash Player). This player can only support HDS content. In order to test HLS content, a Primetime Browser TVSDK-enabled player is required. 

1. Host your content on a web server.
1. Launch the Primetime DRM (formerly called Adobe Access) player at https://drmtest2.adobe.com:8080/AccessPlayer/player.html.
1. Paste the URL to your HDS manifest ( [!DNL .f4m]) into the player's navigation field and click the **[!UICONTROL Play]** button.
