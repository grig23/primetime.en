# Policy criticality{#policy-criticality}

If new usage rules are used in the policies and these policies are used in content packaged for older license servers (which do not understand the new usage rules), you may specify how older license servers should behave. By default, the policy criticality is “true”, meaning that the license server must understand all parts of the policy in order to generate a license using the policy. If the policy criticality is set to “false”, an older license server may ignore parts of the policy it does not understand, and licenses generated by the server will not contain the new usage rules.

Adobe Access servers using version 2.0.2 of the SDK and higher will honor the policy criticality setting.
