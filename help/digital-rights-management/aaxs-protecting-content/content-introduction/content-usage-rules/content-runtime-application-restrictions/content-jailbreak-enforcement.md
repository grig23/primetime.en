# Jailbreak Enforcement (requires Adobe Primetime) {#jailbreak-enforcement-requires-adobe-primetime}

On platforms that supports jailbreak detection (such as Android and iOS mobile devices), enabling jailbreak enforcement disallows playback of content if [!DNL jailbreak/root] has been detected on the device.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This usage rule is supported by Adobe Access clients version 4.0 and higher, but has no effect on platforms that do not support jailbreak detection. The behavior on older clients depends on the minimum client version supported by the license server.
