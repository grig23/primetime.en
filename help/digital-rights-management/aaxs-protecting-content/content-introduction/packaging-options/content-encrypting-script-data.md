# Encrypting script data{#encrypting-script-data}

Specifies whether script data embedded in the content is encrypted.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This rule only applies for FLV file format. Script data is always left in the clear for files in the F4V format.

Example use case: Use this option to leave script data unencrypted, which allows for metadata aggregation tools to read the metadata of protected content.
