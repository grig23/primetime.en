# Multiple policies{#multiple-policies}

Specify multiple policies to be associated with a single piece of content. The specific policy to be used is determined by the license server.

Example use case: If the same asset is used for both electronic sell-through and rental models, this option allows you to specify different sets of usage rules for each business model. The license server can choose which policy to use based on whether the customer purchased or rented the content.
