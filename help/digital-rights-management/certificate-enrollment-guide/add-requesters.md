# Add Requesters{#add-requesters}

An Adobe Primetime DRM licensee can have up to five Requesters. Adobe advises you, however, to limit the number of Requesters to the individuals who are developing the Primetime DRM solution. The Requesters are responsible for storing the private key in a secure location. 

1. An administrator logs on to the Certificate Enrollment site with a valid Adobe ID that contains the domain name of the licensee.
1. On the Home page, click **[!UICONTROL Add a Requester]**.
1. On the User accounts tab, do *one* of the following:

    * Add user.

      If the employee has an Adobe account, enter the e-mail address. Click **[!UICONTROL Add]** and continue. 
    * Invite user.

      If the employee doesn't have an Adobe account, invite them to create one. Enter the e-mail address and name of the employee and click **[!UICONTROL Send an invitation]**. The site sends an e-mail invitation to the invitee. The e-mail contains a link to adobe.com where the invitee can create an account. The invitee must use the e-mail address to which the invitation was sent.

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >The administrator does not receive notification when a user has created an account. Check the **[!UICONTROL User accounts]** tab on the Certificate Enrollment site to see whether an invitee has created an account.

1. If you added a user, the role section screen in the **[!UICONTROL User accounts]** tab opens. Do the following:

    1. Confirm that the user's information is correct. 
    1. Enter the company phone number and challenge phrase.

       The user must know this phrase to verify their account. 
    1. For User type, select **[!UICONTROL Requester]**. 
    1. Click Save.

       The Requester receives an e-mail stating that their Primetime DRM account registration has been completed.

1. If you invited a user, do the following:

    1. Log on to the Certificate Enrollment site. 
    1. Select the **[!UICONTROL User accounts]** tab. 
    1. Locate the user in the **[!UICONTROL Invitations Sent]** section and click **[!UICONTROL Authorize]**.     
    
       >[!NOTE]
       >
       >If there isn't an **[!UICONTROL Authorize]** link in the **[!UICONTROL Actions]** column, the invitee hasn't created an Adobe account yet.

    1. Confirm that the Requester's information is correct. 
    1. Enter the company phone number and challenge phrase.

       The Requester must know this phrase to verify their account. 
    1. For User type, select **[!UICONTROL Requester]**. 
    1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

       The user receives an e-mail stating that their Primetime DRM account registration has been completed.
