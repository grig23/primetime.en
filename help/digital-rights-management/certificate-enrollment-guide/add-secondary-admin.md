# Create a Secondary Administrator{#create-a-secondary-administrator}

The Account Administrator can create a Secondary Administrator. There can be only one Secondary Administrator. The Account Administrator can promote the Secondary Administrator to Account Administrator. This action demotes the Account Administrator to the role of Secondary Administrator. 

1. The Account Administrator logs on to the Certificate Enrollment site with a valid Adobe ID that contains the domain name of the licensee.
1. On the **[!UICONTROL User accounts]** tab, do one of the following:

    * **[!UICONTROL Add user]**.

      If the employee has an Adobe account, enter the e-mail address. Click **[!UICONTROL Add]** and continue. 
    
    * **[!UICONTROL Invite user]** If the employee doesn't have an Adobe account, invite them to create one. Enter the e-mail address and name of the employee and click **[!UICONTROL Send an invitation]**. The site sends an e-mail invitation to the invitee. The e-mail contains a link to adobe.com where the invitee can create an account. The invitee must use the e-mail address to which the invitation was sent.
