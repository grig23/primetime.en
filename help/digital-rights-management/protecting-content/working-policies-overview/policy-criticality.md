# DRM policy criticality{#drm-policy-criticality}

If you plan to apply new usage rules in a DRM policy, and if you plan to use this DRM policy in content that has been packaged for older license servers (and therefore does not correctly interpret the new usage rules) you may need to specify how older license servers need to behave. By default, the DRM policy criticality is set to `true`.

This setting indicates that the license server must process all parts of the DRM policy before it can generate a license that uses the specified DRM policy. If the DRM policy criticality is set to `false`, an older license server may ignore those parts of the DRM policy that it cannot interpret correctly. Therefore any licenses that generated by the server do not include any new usage rules.

Primetime DRM servers that support version 2.0.2 of the SDK or later accept the DRM policy criticality setting.
