# Multiple DRM policies {#multiple-drm-policies}

You can specify multiple Primetime DRM policies to associate with a single section of content. The license server determines which policy is used.

Example use case: If the same asset is used for both electronic sell-through and rental models, this option enables you to specify different sets of usage rules for each business model. The license server can select the Primetime DRM policy that should be used based on whether the customer purchased or rented the content.
