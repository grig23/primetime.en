# Jailbreak enforcement (requires Adobe Primetime DRM){#jailbreak-enforcement-requires-adobe-primetime-drm}

On platforms that support jailbreak detection, such as Android and iOS mobile devices, you can enable jailbreak enforcement to disallow playback of content if [!DNL jailbreak/root] has been detected on the device.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This usage rule is supported by Adobe Primetime DRM client version 4.0 or later. However, it has no effect on platforms that do not support jailbreak detection. The behavior on older clients depends on the minimum client version supported by the license server.
