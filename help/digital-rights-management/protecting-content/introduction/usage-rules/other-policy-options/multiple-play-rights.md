# Multiple play rights {#multiple-play-rights}

You can specify the multiple play rights parameter for different usage rules that you apply to different platforms or applications.

Example use case: Using multiple play rights, you can create an Primetime DRM policy to specify that Output Protection is required on the Microsoft® Windows® platform. However, it is optional on the Apple® Macintosh® and Linux® platforms.
