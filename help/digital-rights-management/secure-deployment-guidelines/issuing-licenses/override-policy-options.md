# Overriding policy options{#overriding-policy-options}

When you issue a license, the license server can override the usage rules that are specified in the policy.

If the policy specifies a start date, a license is not generated before that start date. However, you can set a future start date in the license after the license has been generated. This option should be used with caution because the client cannot prevent the user from moving the system time forward to circumvent the start date.
