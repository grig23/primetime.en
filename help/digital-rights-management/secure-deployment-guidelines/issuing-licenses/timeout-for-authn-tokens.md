# Timeout for authentication tokens{#timeout-for-authentication-tokens}

All authentication tokens that are generated by the Adobe Primetime DRM SDK have a timeout interval to protect application security.

The expiration for the authentication token is specified use the Primetime DRM SDK when handling an authentication request. After it has expired, the token is no longer valid, and the user must authenticate again with the license server.

To learn more about authentication requests, see [AuthenticationHandler](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/primetime/api/drm-apis/server/javadocs-flashaccess-pro/com/adobe/flashaccess/sdk/protocol/authentication/AuthenticationHandler.html).
