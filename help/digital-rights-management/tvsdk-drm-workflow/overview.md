# TVSDK-DRM client-side workflow overview {#tvsdk-drm-client-side-workflow-overview}

Adobe Primetime DRM, Adobe's content protection solution, is integrated into Primetime TVSDK. Primetime DRM also features server-side components, including a license server, individualization server, command-line tools, and more.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Primetime DRM was previously called Adobe Access, and before that, Flash Access. The client-side aspect is still referred to as Access.

As an alternative, or in addition to Primetime DRM (Access), on some platforms you can employ a Multi-DRM solution for your TVSDK application (including for example, the FairPlay, Widevine, and PlayReady DRM solutions). For the latest Multi-DRM platform support information, check with your Adobe representative, and see the [Multi-DRM documentation](../multi-drm-workflows/title-page/overview.md).
