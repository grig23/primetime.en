# Using the DRMStatusEvent class overview {#using-the-drmstatusevent-class-overview}

A `DRMStatusEvent` object is dispatched when the content protected by Primetime DRM begins playing successfully. (Success implies that the license is verified and that the user is authenticated and authorized to view the content).

The `DRMStatusEvent` object contains information related to the license, including whether the license can be made available offline or when the license expires and the content can no longer be viewed.
