# Advertising requirements{#advertising-requirements}

You can insert ads in your VOD and live/linear content by using the Adobe Primetime ad decisioning interface. Primetime ad decisioning works with Browser TVSDK to identify ad opportunities, resolve ads, and insert resolved ads in your video streams.

To incorporate ads in your video content, ensure that the advertising and main video content meets the following requirements:

* The advertising content's HLS version cannot be higher than the main content's HLS version. 
* Ads do not have to be multiplexed (with no restrictions), regardless of whether the main content is multiplexed.
