# Product overview and audience{#product-overview-and-audience}

This guide provides information about how to develop video player applications using Browser TVSDK.

## Product overview {#section_1C66E736CEFD4246B7C7C99AADD48118}

The Adobe Primetime Software Development Kit (Browser TVSDK) is a toolkit that allows you to add advanced video playback functionality, content protection, and advertising to your browser-based video player applications. Browser TVSDK provides JavaScript APIs to build browser-based video applications, and includes playback support in the following modes:

* HTML5 only
* HTML5 with auto flash fallback
* Flash always

This release includes the Browser TVSDK APIs and a sample reference implementation.

### UI Framework

To help accelerate the UI development for JavaScript-based video player applications for browsers, Browser TVSDK includes a UI framework that consists of APIs to:

* Include default UI controls such as play/pause, volume, and so on
* Easily add (or remove) advanced playback UI controls without manipulating the DOM structure directly
* Easily configure the behavior for the associated UI controls
* Create custom UI controls
* Skin the player UI based on requirements

For more information about the APIs for the UI framework, see [UI Framework for Browser TVSDK 2.4](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/primetime/api/psdk/btvsdk-ui-framework/index.html).
