You can track video use by integrating TVSDK with Adobe Analytics.

Video tracking in TVSDK uses the **Adobe Analytics Video Essentials** service, which provides video engagement metrics, such as video views, video completes, ad impressions, time spent on video, and so on. For more information about this service, contact your Adobe representative.

The following procedure summarizes the steps to activate video tracking in your player:

1. Initialize and/or configure the following video tracking components:

   On Android, these components are part of TVSDK:

    * JSON configuration file 
    * Video analytics metadata object 
    * Global metadata object

1. Set up video analytics reporting on the server side by using Adobe Analytics Admin Tools.
