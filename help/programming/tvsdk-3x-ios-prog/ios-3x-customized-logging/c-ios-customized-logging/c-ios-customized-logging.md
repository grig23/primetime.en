# Customized logging {#customized-logging}

You can implement your own logging system.

In addition to logging by using predefined notifications, you can implement a logging system that uses your log messages and messages that are generated by TVSDK. For more information about predefined notifications, see [The Notification System](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/primetime/psdk/ios/index.html#PSDKs-concept-The_Notification_System). You can use these logs to troubleshoot your player applications and to provide better understanding of the playback and advertising workflow.

Customized logging uses a shared singleton instance of the `PSDKPTLogFactory`, which provides a mechanism to log messages to multiple loggers. You define and add (register) one or more loggers to the `PTLogFactory`. This allows you to define multiple loggers with custom implementations, such as a console logger, a web logger, or a console history logger.

TVSDK generates log messages for many of its activities, which the `PTLogFactory` forwards to all registered loggers. Your application can also generate custom log messages, which are forwarded to all registered loggers. Each logger can filter the messages and take appropriate action.

There are two implementations for `PTLogFactory`:

* For listening to logs. 
* For adding logs to a `PTLogFactory`.

## Listen to logs {#listen-to-logs}

 To register for listening to logs: 
1. Implement a custom class that follows the protocol `PTLogger`:

   ```
   @implementation PTConsoleLogger 
    
   + (PTConsoleLogger *) consoleLogger { 
       return [[[PTConsoleLogger alloc] init] autorelease]; 
   } 
    
   - (void)logEntry:(PTLogEntry *)entry { 
       //Log the message to the console using NSLog  
       NSLog(@"[%@] %@", entry.tag, entry.message); 
   } 
    
   @end
   ```

1. To register the instance to receive logging entries, add an instance of the `PTLogger` to the `PTLoggerFactory`:

   ```
   PTConsoleLogger *logger = [PTConsoleLogger consoleLogger]; 
   // Either use the addLogger method: 
   [[PTLogFactory sharedInstance] addLogger:(logger)] 
    
   //Or replace the preceding line with this macro for ease of use 
   //PTLogAddLogger(logger); 
   
   ```

Here is an example of filtering logs by using the `PTLogEntry` type: 

```
@implementation PTConsoleLogger 
 
+ (PTConsoleLogger *) consoleLogger { 
    return [[[PTConsoleLogger alloc] init] autorelease]; 
} 
 
- (id) init { 
    self = [super init]; 
 
    if (self) { 
        self.logLevel = PTLogEntryTypeInfo; 
    } 
 
    return self; 
} 
 
- (void)logEntry:(PTLogEntry *) entry { 
    //Filtering the entry by log level  
    if (entry.type < _logLevel) { 
        return; 
    } 
 
    //Log the message to the console using NSLog NSLog(@"[%@] %@", entry.tag, entry.message); 
} 
 
@end
```

## Add new log messages {#add-new-log-messages}

 To register to listen to logs: 

   Create a new `PTLogEntry` and add it to `thePTLogFactory`:

   You can manually instantiate a `PTLogEntry` and add it to the `PTLogFactory` shared instance or use one of the macros to accomplish the same task.

   Here is an example of logging using the `PTLogDebug` macro:

<!--<a id="example_F014436E1686468F941F4EBD1A21B18E"></a>-->

```
// The following line creates an instance of PTLogEntry with type PTLogEntryDebug, 
// tag "DEBUG_PLAYBACK", and message "Playback has started". 
// Then the PTLogEntry is automatically added to the PTLogFactory  
 
PTLogDebug(@"[DEBUG_PLAYBACK] Playback has started");
```
