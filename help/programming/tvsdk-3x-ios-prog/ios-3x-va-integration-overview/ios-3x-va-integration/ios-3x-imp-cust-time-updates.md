# Implement custom time updates {#implement-custom-time-updates}

In some analytics implementations, the client application might want to provide a different playhead position than the position that is reported by the TVSDK's localTime value. For example, during a linear stream playback, each program's playhead can be provided relative to its start time.

>[!TIP]
>
>Override this method only if you want to provide a playhead position that is different from the default position.

To override the default playhead position:

```
vaTrackingMetadata.currentTimeUpdateBlock = ^CMTime () { 
    NSInteger random = arc4random() % 500;  
    return CMTimeMakeWithSeconds(random, 1); 
};
```

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >In this code sample, 500 is only a sample value. You need to use a different value for your custom playhead position.
