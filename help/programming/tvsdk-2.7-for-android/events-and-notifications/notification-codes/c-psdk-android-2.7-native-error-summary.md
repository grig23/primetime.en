## NATIVE_ERROR: DRM values {#section_D240082B93D34902A18C3923C1C717B3}

The Video Encoder interface of the Adobe video engine returns these DRM notifications in the `NATIVE_ERROR` metadata object.

When reporting DRM errors to Adobe, ensure that you include the `NATIVE_SUBERROR_CODE` and `DRM_ERROR_STRING` for troubleshooting assistance.

>[!TIP]

>This list provides TVSDK-specific information about the errors. For complete descriptions, see [ActionScript Run-Time Errors ActionScript Reference for the Adobe Flash Platform](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/runtimeErrors.html#3300).
