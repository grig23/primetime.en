# Overview {#playback-and-failover-overview}

Streaming over the Internet requires a constant and stable connection to play a stream from a remote server. However, the variability of a viewer's Internet connection or streaming playback means that remote playback might not have the quality of media that is played locally.

Primetime streaming provides failover protection to protect playback from certain remote server failures or operational failures, which makes a better viewing experience. Despite transmission problems, TVSDK implements failover protection to minimize playback interruptions and achieve a seamless playback. The video player automatically switches to a backup media set when entire renditions or fragments are unavailable.
