# DVR without ad insertion {#dvr-without-ad-insertion}

By default, a live stream with DVR support exposes a seekable range in which the viewer can pause and seek.

You can enhance the player control bar for DVR with the following additional features:

* Hide the current playback timestamp and remaining timestamp on the sides of the control bar. 
* Highlight the seekable range in the control bar. 
* Change the duration of the control bar to be the seekable range of the stream instead of the playback range of the stream.

  The seekable range is a subset of the playable range in which ads can be inserted safely. 
* Choose a custom starting point for when to enter a stream.
