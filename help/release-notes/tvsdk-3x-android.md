The Android reference player is included with Android TVSDK in the samples/ directory of your distribution. The accompanying README.md file explains how to build the reference player.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To successfully build the reference player, as described in the README.md distributed with the release, make sure you do the following:
>
>1. Download VideoHeartbeat.jar from [https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/video-heartbeat-v2/releases](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/video-heartbeat-v2/releases) (VideoHeartbeat library for Android v2.0.0)
>1. Extract VideoHeartbeat.jar into the libs/ folder.

TVSDK for Android provides many performance improvements over previous versions. It provides a high quality viewing experience and carries all the features of version 1.4, with the exception of Multi-CDN support.

The comprehensive set of features supported and not supported are presented in the [Features Matrix](#feature-matrix) section of the release notes.

## Android TVSDK 3.13

Widevine DRM stream freezes or shows black frames on ABR switch on FireTV devices, which include Fire TV 3rd generation Pendant and Fire TV Cube 1st and 2nd generation devices.

To resolve the issue, set the API `MediaPlayer.flushVideoDecoderOnHeaderChange(true)` for the specified Fire TV devices before initiating playback. The default value is false.

### New features and enhancements in the previous releases

## Android TVSDK 3.12

Primetime Reference applicationâ€™s gradle version is now updated to version 5.6.4. 

To setup and run Reference app using Android Studio follow the instructions from ReadMe file available with TVSDK zip at `TVSDK_Android_x.x.x.x/samples/PrimetimeReference/src/README.md`.

Top customer issues fixed in the current release are mentioned in [resolved issues](#resolved-issues) section.

**Android TVSDK 3.11**

* **Protection System Specific Header (PSSH) Box fetching allowed** - TVSDK allows fetching of Protection System Specific Header Box associated with current loaded Media Resource. New API `getPSSH()` added to `com.adobe.mediacore.drm.DRMManager`.

For more information, see [Widevine DRM](../programming/tvsdk-3x-android-prog/android-3x-content-security/android-3x-drm-widevine.md).

**Android TVSDK 3.10**

The release focused on fixing top customer issues as mentioned in [resolved issues](#resolved-issues) section.

**Android TVSDK 3.9**

* **Secure Delivery over HTTPS** - Android TVSDK 3.9 introduced the secure delivery capabilities via HTTPS to deliver content securely with unparalleled scale and performance.

  To enable secure delivery over HTTPS, new API introduced in `NetworkConfiguration` class.

  `public void setForceHTTPS (boolean value)`

  `public boolean getIsForceHTTPS()`

**Android TVSDK 3.8**

* **Pre-Roll support with Partial Ad-Break feature** - With this enhancement, TVSDK 3.8 supports pre-roll ads with Partial Ad-Break feature (PABI).

The pre-roll ad, if available, is played, and then the content plays from the live point emulating the experience of live television.

**Android TVSDK 3.7**

* For Widevine test content, a new API `setMediaDrmCallback` in DRMManager class is exposed to override the default implementation of MediaDrmCallback interface.

  `public static void setMediaDrmCallback(MediaDrmCallback callback)`

* Fixed AppCrash error for not handling `MediaPlayerEvent.ITEM_UPDATED` in C++ layer (Android 64 bit).

**Android TVSDK 3.6**

* **Enhance your apps for the 64-bit requirement** - The native library `(libAVEAndroid.so)` is now upgraded and made available in two versions. Existing armeabi (32 bit) native library location has been changed from `/framework/Player to /framework/Player/armeabi` and an additional arm64-v8a (64 bit) library is introduced in `/framework/Player/arm64-v8a.`

**Version 3.5**

* **Just In Time Ad Resolution** - TVSDK 3.5 removes support of the played ads from the timeline.

* **Enabled support for offline playback** - With offline playback, users can now download video content to their devices and watch it when they are not connected. For detailed information, refer to "[Offline Playback with Android](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/primetime/programming-guides/psdk_android_3.5.pdf)."

**Version 3.4**

* TVSDK now supports CMAF streams playback for CBC encrypted and plain streams.

**Version 3.3**

* **API changes**

  * A new API is added to `NetworkConfiguration::setNumOfTimesManifestRetryBeforeError(n)*` to handle network errors and timeouts.
    * where (n) is the number of retries.

**Version 3.2**

* **Parallel Ad Resolution and Manifest download support**

  * TVSDK 3.2 supports the simultaneous resolution, instead of the sequential resolution for all the Ad requests and Ad breaks except for VMAP.

  * All the ad manifests in an ad break are downloaded simultaneously.

* **Enabled support for Ad Resolution and Manifest Download Timeout.**

  * Users can now set the timeout value for overall ad resolution and manifest downloads.  In the case of VMAP, the timeout value applies for individual ad breaks as all the ad breaks are resolved sequentially.

* **Introduced new APIs in AdvertisingMetadata Class:**

  * `void setAdResolutionTimeout(int adResolutionTimeout)`

  * `int getAdResolutionTimeout()`

  * `void setAdManifestTimeout(int adManifestTimeout)`

  * `int getAdManifestTimeout()`

* **Removed below APIs from AdvertisingMetadata Class:**

  * `void setAdRequestTimeout(int adRequestTimeout)`

  * `int getAdRequestTimeout()`

* **Enabled playback of streams with AC3/EAC3 audio codec**

  * `void alwaysUseAC3OnSupportedDevices(boolean val)` in `MediaPlayer` class

* **TVSDK supports CMAF and plain streams playback for encrypted Widevine CTR.**

* **Playback of 4K HEVC streams is now supported.**

* **Parallel ad call requests** - TVSDK now prefetches 20 ad call requests in parallel.

**Version 3.0**

* **TVSDK 3.0 supports High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) streams.**

* **Just in Time - Resolving ads closer to ad markers**
Lazy Ad Resolving now resolves each ad break independently. Previously, ad resolution was a two-phased approach: pre-rolls were resolved prior to playback start and all mid/post roll slots combined after playback started. With this enhanced feature, each ad break is now resolved at a specific time prior to the ad cue point.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Lazy Ad Resolving has now changed to be turned off by default, and explicitly needs to be enabled.

A new API is added to `AdvertisingMetadata::setDelayAdLoadingTolerance` to get the delayed ad loading tolerance associated with this Advertising Metadata.  
Seeking is now allowed immediately after PREPARATION, seeking over ad breaks will result in immediate resolution before the completion of the seek.  
Signaling modes `SERVER_MAP` and `MANIFEST_CUES` are supported.  
  
For more information, see [TVSDK 3.0 for Android Programmer's Guide](../programming/tvsdk-3x-android-prog/android-3x-advertising/ad-insertion/c-lazy-ad-resolving/c-lazy-ad-resolving.md) on API and event changes.

* **Updated `targetSdkVersion` to latest Version**  
  
Updated `targetSdkVersion` from 19 to 27 for smooth functioning.

* **Placement.Type getPlacementType() is now a method on interface TimelineMarker**

  This method will return a placement type of Placement.Type.PRE_ROLL, Placement.Type.MID_ROLL or Placement.Type.POST_ROLL. If an ad break is unresolved, the getDuration() method on the TimelineMarker interface will return 0.

**Version 2.5.6.**

* **TVSDK 2.5 supports Android P.**

* **Enabling Background Audio**

  To enable audio playback when app moves from foreground to background, app should call `enableAudioPlaybackInBackground` API of MediaPlayer with true as argument when player is in PREPARED state.

* **alwaysUseAudioOutputLatency(boolean val) in MediaPlayer class**

When set, use output latency in the audio timestamp calculation.
Boolean parameters val - True will use audio output latency in audio timestamp calculation.

* **Optimized to get the best playback experience even if the bandwidth speed falls off suddenly**

TVSDK now cancels the ongoing segment's download, if required, and dynamically switches to the appropriate rendition. This is done by seamlessly switching among the bitrates without interruptions.

**Version 2.5.5**

* **Partial Ad-Break Insertion**  

  TV-like experience of joining in the middle of an ad without firing the tracking for the partially watched ad.  
  Example: User joins in the middle (at 40 seconds) of a 90-second ad break consisting of three 30-second ads. This is 10 seconds into the second ad in the break.

  * The second ad plays for the remaining duration (20 sec) followed by the third ad.
  
  * Ad trackers for the partial ad played (second ad) are not fired. The trackers for only the third ad are fired.

* **Secure Ad Loading over HTTPS**

  Adobe Primetime provides an option to request first call to primetime ad server and CRS over https.

* **AdSystem and Creative Id added to CRS requests**

  Now including `AdSystem` and `CreativeId` as new parameters in the 1401 and 1403 requests.

* **API setEncodeUrlForTracking in NetworkConfiguration class removed** as the unsafe characters in a URL should be encoded.

**Version 2.5.4**

Android TVSDK v2.5.4 offers the following updates and API changes:

* Changes in default value for `WebViewDebbuging`

  `WebViewDebbuging` value is set to `Fals`e by default. To enable it, call `setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(true)` in the application.

* **OpenSSL and Curl version upgrade**

  Updated libcurl to v7.57.0 and OpenSSL to v1.0.2k.

* App level access for VAST response object

  Introduced a new API `NetworkAdInfo::getVastXml()` that provides access of the VAST response object to the application.

**Version 2.5.3**

Android TVSDK v2.5.3 offers the following updates and API changes.

* All TVSDK customers who use CRS are encouraged to upgrade their apps with TVSDK 2.5.3.85 or latest on Android. This will be a drop-in replacement to the existing app implementation. After the TVSDK upgrade, check for the CRS creative URL requests in a proxy tool (ex: Charles) and confirm that the host name and version in the path reflects as in the sample URL structure below.

  `https://primetime-a.akamaihd.net/assets/3p/v3.1/222000/167/d77/167d775d00cbf7fd224b112sf5a4bc7d_0e34cd3ca5177fbc74d66d784 bf3586d.m3u8`

* TVSDK's User Agent customizable: we have added some new API's to customize the user agents.

  * `setCustomUserAgent(String value)`
  * `getCustomUserAgent()`

* Share cookies between Android Application and TVSDK: Android TVSDK now supports accessing of cookies between JAVA layer (stored in CookieStore of the Android Application) and the C++ TVSDK layer. Now, it's possible to set and/or modify the cookies in native C++ layer as they will be exposed to the Java Cookie Store.

* API changes:

  * A new Event `CookiesUpdatedEvent` is added. It gets dispatched by the media player when its cookie is updated.

  * A new API is added to `NetworkConfiguration::set/ getCustomUserAgent()` to use custom user agent.

  * A new API is added to `NetworkConfiguration::set/ getEncodedUrlForTracking` to force Encoding of Unsafe characters.

  * A new API is added to `NetworkConfiguration::getNetworkDownVerificationUrl()` to set a network verification URL in case of a failover.

  * A new property is added to `TextFormat::treatSpaceAsAlphaNum` which define whether to treat space as alphanumeric while displaying captions.

* Changes in `SizeAvailableEvent`. Previously, `getHeight()` and `getWidth()` methods of `SizeAvailableEvent` in 2.5.2 used to return Frame height and frame width, which was returned by media format. Now it returns output height and output width respectively returned by decoder.

* Changes in Buffering behavior: Buffering behavior is changed. Its left up to App developer on what they want to do in case of buffer empty. 2.5.3 uses play buffer size at buffer empty situation.

**Version 2.5.2**

Android TVSDK v2.5.2 offers important bug fixes and a few API changes.

**Version 2.5.1**

The important new features released in Android 2.5.1.

* **Performance Improvements -** The new TVSDK 2.5.1 architecture brings a number of performance improvements. Based on statistics from a third party benchmarking study, the new architecture provides a 5x reduction in startup time and 3.8x fewer dropped frames compared to the industry average:

* **Instant on for VOD and live -** When you enable instant on, the TVSDK initializes and buffers media before playback starts. Because you can launch multiple MediaPlayerItemLoader instances simultaneously in the background, you can buffer multiple streams. When a user changes the channel, and the stream has buffered properly, playback on the new channel starts immediately. TVSDK 2.5.1 also supports the Instant On for **live** streams also. The live streams are re-buffered when the live window moves.

* **Improved ABR logic -** The new ABR logic is based on buffer length, rate of change of buffer length, and measured bandwidth. This ensures that the ABR chooses the right bit rate when the bandwidth fluctuates and also optimizes the number of times the bitrate switch actually happens by monitoring the rate at which the buffer length changes.
  
* **Partial Segment Download / Sub-segmentation -** TVSDK further reduces the size of each fragment, in order to start playback as soon as possible. The ts fragment must have a key frame every two seconds.

* **Lazy ad resolution -** TVSDK doesn't wait for resolution of non-preroll ads before starting playback, thus decreasing the startup time. APIs like seek and trick-play are still not allowed until all ads are resolved. This is applicable to VOD streams used with CSAI. Operations like seek and fast forward are not permitted till the ad resolution is completed. For live streams this feature cannot be enabled for ad resolution during a live event.

* **Persistent network connections -** This feature allows TVSDK to create and store an internal list of persistent network connections. These connections are reused for multiple requests, rather than opening a new connection for each network request and then destroying it afterwards. This increases efficiency and decreases latency in the networking code resulting in faster playback performance.
When TVSDK opens a connection it asks the server for a *keep-alive* connection. Some servers may not support this type of connection, in which case TVSDK will fall back to making a connection for each request again. Also, while persistent connections will be on by default, TVSDK now has a configuration option so that apps can turn persistent connections off if desired.

* **Parallel download -** Downloading video and audio in parallel rather than in series reduces startup delays. This feature allows HLS Live and VOD files to be played, optimizes the available bandwidth usage from a server, lowers the probability of getting into buffer under-run situations, and minimizes the delay between download and playback.

* **Parallel ad downloads -** TVSDK prefetches ads in parallel to the content playback before hitting the ad breaks thus enabling seamless playback of ads and content.

* **Playback**

* **MP4 Content Playback -** MP4 short clips do not need to be re-transcoded to play back within TVSDK.

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >ABR switching, trick play, ad insertion, late audio binding, and sub-segmentation are not supported for MP4 playback.

* **Trick play with adaptive bit rate (ABR) -** This feature allows TVSDK to switch between iFrame streams while in trick play mode. You can use non-iFrame profiles to do trick play at lower speeds.

* **Smoother trick play -** These improvements enhance the user experience:

  * Adaptive bit-rate and frame rate selection during trick play, based on bandwidth and buffer profile

  * Use of the main stream instead of the IDR stream to get up to 30 fps fast playback.

* **Content Protection**

  * **Resolution-based output protection -** This feature ties playback restrictions to specific resolutions, providing finer grained DRM controls.

* **Workflow Support**

  * **Direct Billing Integration -** This sends billing metrics to the Adobe Analytics backend, which is certified by Adobe Primetime for streams used by the customer.

  TVSDK automatically collects metrics, abiding by the customer sales contract to generate periodic usage reports required for billing purposes. On every stream start event, TVSDK uses the Adobe Analytics data insertion API to send billing metrics such as content type, ad insertion enabled flags, and drm enabled flags - based on the duration of the billable stream - to the Adobe Analytics Primetime owned report suite. This does not interfere with or get included in the customer's own Adobe Analytics report suites or server calls. On request, this billing usage report is sent to customers periodically. This is the first phase of the billing feature supporting usage billing only. It can be configured based on the sales contract using the APIs described in the documentation. This feature is enabled by default. To turn this feature off, refer to the reference player sample.

  * **Improved Failover Support -** Additional strategies implemented to continue uninterrupted playback, despite failures of host servers, playlist files, and segments.

* **Advertising**

  * **Moat Integration -** Support for ad viewability measurement from Moat.
  
  * **Companion banners -** Companion banners are displayed alongside a linear ad and often continue to be displayed on the view after the ad ends. These banners can be of type html (an HTML snippet) or type iframe (a URL to an iframe page).

* **Analytics**

  * **VHL 2.0 -** This is the latest optimized Video Heartbeats Library (VHL) integration for automatic collection of usage data for Adobe Analytics. The complexity of the APIs has been decreased to to ease the implementation. Download the VHL library [v2.0.0 for Android](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/video-heartbeat-v2/releases) and extract the JAR file in the libs folder.

* **SizeAvaliableEventListener**

  * `getHeight()` and `getWidth()` methods of `SizeAvailableEvent` will now return output in height and width respectively. Display aspect ratio can be calculated as follows:
  
    ```java
    SizeAvailableEvent e;
    DAR = e.getWidth()/ e.getHeight();
    ```
  
    Storage Aspect Ratio in terms of Sar width and Sar height can also be used to calculate Frame width and Frame height:

    ```java
    SAR = e.getSarWidth()/e.getSarHeight();
    frameHeight = e.getHeight();
    frameWidth = e.getWidth()/SAR;
    ```

* **Cookies**

  * Android TVSDK now supports access to JAVA cookies stored in CookieStore of the Android Application. A Callback API (onCookiesUpdated) is provided to record whenever a new Cookie comes as part of **Set-Cookie** Response header. These cookies are available as a List of HttpCookie(s) used for a different URI/domain by setting these cookie values on that particular URI/domain using CookieStore. Similarly the cookie values in TVSDK are updated using CookieStore add API.

  * Added new API in the network configuration for handling this enhancement. If this API is not used, then manifest is not retried. If it is used then manifest will be retried for handling network errors and timeouts.

**Version 3.2**

* ZD#37493- Tracking beacons for live playback do not get fired intermittently for the first ad in sequence.
* ZD#36985- Tracking beacons are not sent for empty ad breaks in VMAP response. 
* ZD#37134 - TVSDK throws the wrong ID for VMAP response intermittently.

**Version 3.0**

* ZD#33740 - TVSDK throws an unneeded warning just after creating a MediaPlayer object and calling replaceCurrentResource()

  * Improved the earlier fix by calling restore only when player is in suspended state

* ZD#36442 - Every new playback disconnects remote debugging session making it impossible to debug.

  * Debug not possible by default on web view as debugging is not enabled by default. App should enable debugging if required by calling setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(true) on object returned from MediaPlayer.getCustomAdView().

* ZD#33688 - Support for Just In Time ad resolving

  * Ad breaks are resolved at a specified interval prior to the position of the ad break.

* ZD#36441 - Duration of live window keeps increasing beyond 5 minutes causing multiple issues.

  * Added `enableAudioPlaybackInBackground` API of MediaPlayer which should be called with 'True' as argument (when player is in PREPARED state) to enable playback of audio when app is in background.

**Android TVSDK 2.5.5**

* ZD #21647 - Android TVSDK notifies 640x368 when actual video size is 640x360.

  * Due to variable m_nOutputHeight (inside AndroidMCVideoDecoder) getting updated with frame height instead of actual output height. Made relevant changes in function getVideoFrame to calculate m_nOutputHeight correctly.

* ZD #26614 - Urgent --- 3rd party ad serving / programmatic --- failure to serve impressions.

  * Enhanced the earlier fix by handling the case in XML parsing where issue was reproducible when "space" is before the "equal" sign like &lt;VAST version ="2.0"&gt;

* ZD #29296 - Android: Add AdSystem and Creative id to CRS requests.

    * Now including 'AdSystem' and 'CreativeId' as new parameters in the 1401 and 1403 requests.

* ZD #33062 - TVSDK crashes on the occurrence of pipe character in VAST response under CDATA node

  * API setEncodeUrlForTracking in NetworkConfiguration class removed as the unsafe characters in a URL to be encoded

* ZD #33063 - CRS file selection logic was broken - TVSDK was not sending CRS request for webm format but sending it for 3gpp files instead.

  * Fixed the logic now. On using media files with webm and 3gpp format, CRS request to be sent for webm. And on using both the media files with 3gpp format, the CRS request to be sent for the highest bitrate 3gpp file.

* ZD #33125 - Android app crashes with specific DoubleClick tag within the VMAP.

  * Fixed the scenario to avoid the crash.

* ZD #33619 - Fast-forwarding a growing playlist content stuck in buffering state near live point.

  * Handled the case when crossing the live point in trick play mode

* ZD #34151 - TimedMetadata objects out of order.

  * Two TimedMetadata events were appearing in random order if they belonged to same time in the timeline. Maintained their original order in manifest.

* ZD #34189 - Issue when seeking to beginning of ad break.

  * The issue was with SSAI ads which are stitched using discontinuity. And the cause was a behavior when we seek to the begining of such ads, we search for a keyframe and we don't find it. The reason was the ad's min audio timestamp being before min video timestamp. Hence, we end up searching for a key frame at a wrong fragmentDump data. Fixed now.

* ZD #34528 - Video resolution not upgrading beyond 640x360 on FireTV 3rd gen dongle.

  * Enhanced the fix to include latest firmware updates

* ZD #34793 - TVSDK 2.5.x used to crash with custom content resolver in some cases when VideoEngine was assuming that the auditudeSettings are available and they were not.

  * The crash was happening due to a function call on a Null shared pointer (auditudeSettings). Added a conditional check within VideoEngineTimeline::placeToSourceTimeline() to make sure auditudeSettings are available before calling anything on that object.
