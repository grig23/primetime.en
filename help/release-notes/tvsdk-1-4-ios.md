# TVSDK 1.4 for iOS Release Notes {#tvsdk-for-ios-release-notes}

TVSDK 1.4 for iOS Release Notes describe what is new or changed, the resolved and known issues and the device issues in TVSDK iOS 1.4.

## New features {#new-features}

**Version 1.4.45**

* In order to comply with Xcode10, TVSDK has moved from “`libstdc++`” to “`libc++`”, and as a result the minimum supported version is iOS 7. Earlier it was iOS 6.

**Version 1.4.44**

* No new feature or enhancements in this release.

**Version 1.4.43**

* TV-like experience of being able to join in the middle of an ad without triggering partial ad's tracking.  
  Example: User joins in the middle (at 40 seconds) of a 90-second ad break consisting of three 30-second ads. This is 10 seconds into the second ad in the break.

  * The second ad plays for the remaining duration (20 sec) followed by the third ad.
  * Ad trackers for the partial ad played (second ad) are not triggered. The trackers for only the third ad are triggered.

* Added enableVodPreroll property of Boolean type in PTAdMetadata interface. The property can be used to enable pre-roll on a VoD stream. If enableVodPreroll is NO, PSDK does not play pre-roll. This, however, has no impact on the midrolls. The default value of enableVodPreroll is YES.
* closedCaptionDisplayEnabled API of PTMediaPlayer interface is marked as deprecated from iOS v1.4.43 onwards. To determine whether closed captions are available for a given PTMediaPlayerItem, examine the subtitlesOptions property of PTMediaPlayerMediaItem.

**Version 1.4.42**

No new features are added in this release. For a list of issues fixed, see Resolved issues.

**Version 1.4.41**

API changes:

* **isSecure**: A new API is introduced isSecure to secure the player from recording and throwing an error. The default value is true.
* **allowExternalRecording**: A new API is introduced to allow airplay mirroring for a secure content. Airplay mirroring is treated as recording therefore  allowExternalRecording  value must be set to 'True', to allow airplay mirroring or set to 'False' to stop the airplay mirroring for secure content. By default,  value  is true.

**Version 1.4.40**

No new features.

**Version 1.4.39**

* iOS  TVSDK  is certified with VHL 2.0.1 and with VHL 2.0.1 with Nielsen.
* iOS  TVSDK  is updated to make CRS requests from new Akamai host `primetime-a.akamaihd.net`.
* New hostname configuration provides CRS asset delivery via both HTTP and HTTPS (SSL) at greater scale.

**Version 1.4.36**

Integrate and certify VHL 2.0 in iOS TVSDK : Reduce the barrier in the VideoHeartbeatsLibrary implementation by decreasing the complexity of the APIs.

**Version 1.4.34**

* Network Ad Information

  TVSDK APIs now provide additional information on third party VAST responses. Ad ID, Ad System  and  VAST Ad Extensions are provided in `PTNetworkAdInfo` class accessible through  `networkAdInfo`  property on an Ad Asset. This information can be used for integrating with other Ad Analytics platforms such as **Moat Analytics**.

**Version 1.4.31**

* **Billing Metrics** To accommodate customers who want to pay only for what they use, rather than a fixed rate regardless of actual use, Adobe collects usage metrics and uses these metrics to determine how much to bill the customers.

Every time TVSDK generates a stream start event, the player starts to send HTTP messages periodically to Adobe's billing system. The period, known as billable duration, can be different for standard VOD,  pro VOD  (mid-roll ads enabled), and live content. The default duration for each content type is 30 minutes, but your contract with Adobe determines the actual values.

* **Multi-CDN Support for CRS Ads**TVSDK now supports Multi-CDN for CRS ads. By providing FTP details for CRS ads, you can specify CDN locations, other than the default Adobe-owned CDN such as Akamai.

**Version 1.4.29**

In the PTSDKConfig class, the forceHTTPS API has been added.

The PTSDKConfig class provides methods to enforce SSL on requests made to Adobe Primetime ad decisioning, DRM, and Video Analytics servers. For more information, see the `forceHTTPS` and `isForcingHTTPS` methods on this class. If a manifest is loaded over HTTPS, TVSDK preserves the content use of HTTPS and respects this usage when loading any relative URLs from that manifest.

**Note**: Requests to third-party domains such as Ad Tracking pixels, Content and Ad URLs, and similar requests are not modified, and it is the responsibility of the content providers and ad servers to provide URLs that are supported through HTTPS.

**Version 1.4.18**

Primetime iOS TVSDK now supports VPAID 2.0 Javascript creatives to enable a rich interactive in-stream ad experience. 

For more information about VPAID 2.0, see [VPAID ad support](../programming/tvsdk-1.4-for-ios/ad-insertion/c-psdk-ios-1.4-vpaid-2.0-ads.md).

**Version 1.4.17**

* tvOS

  The TVSDK supports tvOS native applications.
* The following types of content can be played:

    * VOD
    * Live
    * AES-128
    * Alternate audio and subtitles
    * FER

* The following types of ads can be displayed:

    * Basic
    * VAST2
    * VAST3
    * VMA

* The following features are currently not supported:

    * Digital Rights Management (DRM)
    * Ad banners
    * TV Markup Language (TVML)

**Version 1.4.13**

**Note**: The Nielsen module has been removed from the TVSDK build, the  TVSDK  will be updated in the near future with a new Nielsen integration module.

* **Ad Fallback, Daisy chaining in ad selection logic (Zendesk #3103)**

For VAST ads (creatives) with the fallback rule enabled, the TVSDK treats an ad with an invalid MIME type as an empty ad and attempts to use fallback ads in its place. You can configure some aspects of fallback behavior. 

For more information, see [Ad fallback for VAST and VMAP ads](../programming/tvsdk-1.4-for-ios/ad-insertion/c-psdk-ios-1.4-ad-fallback.md).

**Version 1.4.9**

* **Blackout Signaling With Alternate Content Replacement**

As part of the 1.4 TVSDK update we also now support going into and returning from regional blackouts against linear content. The TVSDK can now process two manifest files in parallel, main and alternate, to monitor for blackout signals even when alternate programming is being shown in place of the original programming.

**Version 1.4.8**

* **Video Heartbeats Library (VHL) updated to version 1.5**

  * Ability to send metadata with video start and/or video/ad/chapter start as context data
  * Less network traffic - Heartbeats are fewer on average and smaller in size

**Version 1.4.7**

* **On-Premise Individualization Support**

Support for on-premise installations of the Adobe Individualization Server to customize the client's individualization request to go to a different endpoint.

* **Resolution-Based output protection**

DRM Policies can now specify the highest resolution permitted, depending on the device's Output Protection capabilities. For instance "If HDCP is available, allow  content  of up to 1080p resolution to be played, and if HDCP is not available, allow  content  of up to 480p resolution to be played".

**Version 1.4.4**

* **Video Heartbeats Library (VHL) update to version 1.4.1.1**

  * Added the ability to bundle different analytics use cases, from other SDKs or players, with the Adobe Analytics Video Essentials.
  * Ad tracking has been optimized by removing the trackAdBreakStart and trackAdBreakComplete methods. The ad break is inferred from the  trackAdStart  and trackAdComplete method calls.
  * The  playhead  property is no longer needed when tracking ads.
  * Added support for the Marketing Cloud Visitor ID.

* **Nielsen SDK Integration**

  * The TVSDK now supports sending mTVR and MDPR ID3 beacons to the Nielsen SDK without any custom integration. In order to get started, download the 3.1.2.19 Nielsen iOS App SDK.
  
**Version 1.4.0**

* **Blackout Signaling With Alternate Content Replacement**

  * As part of the 1.4 TVSDK update, the TVSDK also now supports going into and returning from regional blackouts against linear content. The TVSDK can now process two manifest files in parallel, main and alternate, to monitor for blackout signals even when alternate programming is being shown in place of the original programming.

* **Remove/Replace C3 Ads**

  * Now, no additional prep work is needed to dynamically insert new ads into video-on-demand (VOD) assets that are coming out of the C3 window. The TVSDK now provides an API to remove custom content ranges and dynamically insert new ads. This powerful new functionality is also useful in cases where live/linear content airs during  broadcast  and is immediately pulled down for use as  on demand  content without proper time to “clean” the asset.

## Device certification and support in 1.4 {#device-certification-and-support-in}

>[!NOTE]

  * TVSDK tvOs support is limited to non-Adobe DRM encrypted streams. You must remove the reference to drmNativeInterface.framework in your tvOS build settings. AES encrypted streams are still supported.
  * Apple requires all Apple TV applications to be bitcode enabled, so you must turn this flag on in your project settings.

## Resolved issues in 1.4 {#resolved-issues-in}

<!-- 

Comment Type: draft

 <p>All TVSDK customers who use CRS are strongly encouraged to upgrade to TVSDK 1.4.39 or latest on iOS and Android. This upgrade is a drop-in replacement to the existing app implementation. After the upgrade, check for the CRS creative URL requests in a proxy tool (for example, Charles) to verify that the version in the path reflects version 3.1. For example:</p> 
 <p><span class="code">https://primetime-a.akamaihd.net/assets/3p/v3.1/222000/167/d77/ 167d775d00cbf7fd224b112sf5a4bc7d_0e34cd3ca5177fbc74d66d784bf3586d.m3u8</span></p> 
-->

<!-- 

Comment Type: draft

 <p>TVSDK versions earlier than version 1.4.28 sometimes exhibit a long delay in the startup time when ad-enabled content is played on devices that are running on iOS 10. To resolve this issue, upgrade to version 1.4.28 or later. Version 1.4.28 was released on August 31, 2016, and iOS 10 was released on September 13, 2016.</p> 

-->

**Version 1.4.45 {#ios-tvsdk}**

* Ticket #36294 - iOS TVSDK not functional with Xcode 10

  * Fixed the compilation issues with TVSDK on XCode 10. Due to XCode 10 requirements, apps build on TVSDK for iOS 1.4.45 onwards require minimum deployment target as iOS 7.0

* Ticket #36321 - Discrepancy observed in seekable range between PTMediaPlayer and AVPlayer instance in "Playing" state.
* Ticket #36493 - `libstdc++` support on iOS 12

  * Fixed the compilation issues with TVSDK on iOS 12. Apps build on TVSDK for iOS 1.4.45 onwards require minimum deployment target as iOS 7.0

**Version 1.4.44**

* Ticket #34683 - Ad Playback Progress Time Is Going In Negative

  * Additional checks put in to handle the case when there is a mismatch between the duration reported by the ad server and actual ad content.

* Ticket #34801 - currentTime and localTime were not getting updated when seeking to a new position during paused status

  * Player's current time can now be set to zero in case player is in paused state; earlier the current time used to be set to zero only in play state.

* Ticket #35037 - Playback stalls with bad URL when returning from signal-based ad insertion.

  * Improved fix provided for closed issue #34385 in 1.4.42 release. Added isCancelled check and exception handling code to make operation queue more robust.

**Version 1.4.43**

* (ZD#32990) - iOS: Content playing instead of ads on some cue-points. 'selectedMediaOptionInMediaSelectionGroup' API which was part of AVPlayerItem interface has now moved under AVMediaSelection in iOS 11. The issue got resolved using this new API.
* (ZD#33683) TVSDK removed == suffix from the metadata strings. The issue is fixed in the parsing logic.
* (ZD#33905) - iOS TVSDK making calls to the manifest files with two user agents. The user agent issue has been fixed in first m3u8 call (fresh install case). M3u8's have the same user-agents for all the calls now.
* (ZD#34293) - Pre-rolls inserted on LINEAR streams do not play correctly on iOS11. The issue is fixed for preroll ads.
* (ZD#34684) - When the ad skip policy is applied, Pre-roll ad frames are shown for few seconds. A new API, enableVodPreroll has been introduced to disable preroll playback in vod playback. The default value for this API is 'Yes'. The API ensures skipping of ad content stitching in the main content.
* (ZD#34765) - After calling stop(), few Transport Streams segments still get downloaded. Enhanced the Stop() API to avoid download of the extra segments.
* (ZD#34865) - Pre-roll ads for livestream are truncated on iOS. Related to iOS11, and adding an additional check to confirm if the stream is pre-roll or main-content, addresses this issue.
* (ZD#35093) - Fixed a failover scenario where, if Primary variant of the stream fails at startup (returns 404), playback does not switch to backup stream.

**Version 1.4.42 (1.4.42.118)**

* (ZD#34385) - Playback stalls with a bad URL when returning from signal-based ad insertion.

  Increase the maximum concurrent counts for CustomAVAssetLoaderOperations, so that the manifest reads can continue to execute.
* (ZD#34373) - End users are not able to stream to HDMI-connected  devices,  when stream recording is disallowed.
* (ZD#32678) - TVSDK does not collect the correct ad IDs on iOS.

  Ad ID of the final Ad creative is now picked up in VHL pings in case of VAST/VMAP redirects.
* (ZD#33904) -  TVSDK  is not Registered for AVFoundation notifications AVAudioSessionMediaServicesWereLostNotification and AVAudioSessionMediaServicesWereResetNotification.

The following issues were resolved for TVSDK in this release:

* (ZD# 24180) Add a custom header to allow list

A new custom header has been added to the TVSDK allow list.

* (ZD# 25016) Failover stream is selected randomly when ABR control parameters are set

This issue was resolved by maintaining the ABR streams in order when the ABR settings are provided with the  initialBitrate  setting on a stream that includes failover URLs. This will avoid playing the failover streams instead of primary.

* (ZD# 25076) Crash on PTAuditudeAdResolver loadComplete

The issue where a crash was occurring during rapid start/stop of multiple PTMediaPlayer instances with ads has been fixed.

* (ZD# 25960) No additional subscribed tags tare triggering metadata change notification broadcasts

* (ZD #25956) VHL - Analytics: Crash when repeatedly playing videos

This issue is the same as ZD #25908.

**Version 1.4.29** (1.4.29.743)

* (ZD# 23901) Third party ads are not playing

This issue was resolved by moving to CRS v3 URL structure to include the zone ID in the repackaged URL.

* (ZD #25183) Issues with DRM playback on tvOS and iOS

This issue was resolved by providing support for multiple key tags that are needed for multi-DRM support.

* (ZD# 25334) TVSDK fails to play a  cDVR  shared content

This issue was resolved by preventing TVSDK from converting empty strings to absolute URLs.

* (ZD# 25347) Set custom HTTP header on AVURLAsset

Support for custom headers on ts segment requests through the PTNetworkConfiguration class has been added.

**Version 1.4.28** (1.4.28.722)

This issue was resolved by updating the logger utility library to the version 7.0 deployment target.

* (ZD #24775) Delayed stream due to Ads

This issue was resolved by correctly calculating the duration drift on event playlists.

* (ZD #24799) Some of the episodes are not playing on iOS APP

This issue was resolved by using local web server for subtitles when the WebVTT files are geo-restricted.

**Version 1.4.27** (1.4.27.711) for iOS 6.0+

* (ZD #24089) - Optimizations for ad resolving on long DVR streams

This issue was resolved by adding multiple optimizations to reduce the time that is required to process the DVR window in live/linear streams.

* (ZD #21554) - TVSDK error beacons not fired for application-type = video/mp4

This issue was resolved by enabling the player to ping the correct error tracking URLs on invalid asset formats.

* (ZD #24424) - Crash of type EXC_BAD_ACCESS KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS is originating from inside PSDKLib for iOS on newer hardware devices.

* (ZD #19574) - The  TVSDK  is not returning M3U8 response data for DRM or non-DRM content

In the initial load of the manifest file in PTMediaPlayerItem.prepareToPlay, if loading the manifest failed, the TVSDK does not report the body of the failure response to the application.

This issue was resolved by allowing the  TVSDK  to report the failure response as an error to the application.

* (ZD #19615) - Fallback logic is not working

In the current implementation, fallback ads were skipped and were not repackaged unless these ads are in the m3u8 format. This issue was resolved by also adding the support for repackaging fallback ads.

Starting in iOS 8, Apple has added an API that allows cookies to be passed for segment requests. This support is now available in the  TVSDK . Support has also been added for sending a user-agent, if available.

* Zendesk #18166 - TVSDK 1.4.15 gives hundreds of warnings when compiling with DWARF with dSYM file options

* Zendesk #3875 - Tab S Crashes during playback

Reverting the dependency of  OKHTTP  on  auditude  for CRS because  TVSDK  is now directly using the  httpurlconnection  instead of curl. The issue was resolved by clearing exceptions before making another JNI call.

* Zendesk #4487 - Tracking Linear Channel of Content

The issue was resolved by re-initializing the video heartbeat tracker during a linear stream playback session.

* Zendesk #17919 - Android - content seek causes heartbeat error

* Zendesk #18072 - Android M - Application Crash

This crash happens while calling MediaCodecList and MediaCodecInfo APIs when checking whether the profile and level are supported. Adobe is seeking Google's support for additional insight. This issue was resolved by providing a temporary  work around  by loading all the codec info ahead of time to avoid calling these APIs only when codec information is needed.

* Zendesk #18074 - Arabic subtitles not working on Nexus with Android 6.0

This issue was resolved by providing support for the Android CTS font map.

* Zendesk #1024 - Feature to remove  ad  from stream via manifest

## Known issues in 1.4 {#known-issues-in}

* In iOS  TVSDK , all ads are stitched into the content manifest. Ad behaviors are implemented by seeking based on the duration of the content and ad segments. So if segment durations are not accurate, seeking may not always end at the exact frame of the beginning or end of the ad break. Even if durations are to the frame, there is a tolerance that the platform itself imposes on seeking and there may be a few frames or ad or content displayed. This is a limitation of the platform and the way ad insertion works with TVSDK on iOS.
* The decision to skip happens on the seek event in this case. However, since the ad segment durations in the manifest do not accurately represent the actual duration of the ad, the seek is not frame accurate. Hence, you see a few frames of the ad when the ad policies are applied.
* RECORDING_ERROR: An error has occurred while recording the screen.
* It might experience that License rotation video does not play on iOS 11 and it will play fine on iOS 9.x and iOS 10.x.
* In VPAID 2.0 support, if the playback is active over AirPlay, VPAID ads are skipped.
* The drmNativeInterface.framework does not link correctly when the minimum target is set to iOS7 (or later).  
  Workaround: Explicitly specify the `libstdc++6`.  dylib  library as follows: Go to Target-&gt;Build Phases-&gt;Link Binary With Libraries and add `libstdc++.6.dylib`.

* Post-Roll Ad not getting inserted for replacing API.
* Seeking in an ad break (without coming out of it) issues a duplicate  ad  start an ad break notification
* Setting currentTimeUpdateInterval does not have any effect.  
  Note: In certain iOS versions, the OS doesn't load the resources inside the PSDKLibrary.framework automatically. It is important to manually copy the PSDKResources.bundle to the application's bundle resources: Go to "Build Phases" and copy bundle resources.
* The Reference App cannot be built using Xcode 8 or lower versions. iOS TVSDK version 1.4.41 onwards, use Xcode 9 to compile.
