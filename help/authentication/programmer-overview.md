## Introduction {#introduction}

This overview is intended for the content provider (Programmer) who plans to integrate Adobe® Pass into their website or application. For additional documentation including Kickstart and Integration guides, see [Related Information](#Related) below.

Today your viewers can get on the Internet anytime, anywhere, and
request access to protected content directly from you, the Programmer.
They may want to watch a one-time event, or they may be seeking viewing
rights to an entire television series that you are airing. 

But before you allow access to your protected content, you have to
determine whether a customer is entitled to view that content. Do they
have a subscription with a Multichannel Video Programming Distributor
(MVPD)? If so, does that subscription include your programming? 

Determing a viewer's entitlement is not always simple for a Programmer.
The MVPDs hold the identifying data and access privileges for their
customers.  Add the fact that viewers trying to access your protected
content subscribe to a variety of MVPDs, each of which have different
systems, and it is easy to see that determing viewer's entitlement to
protected content can quickly become complicated and technically
challenging:

User Entitlement Determined Directly By Programmer  

Adobe Primetime authentication for TV Everywhere securely mediates these
entitlement transactions between Programmers and MVPDs. Adobe Primetime
authentication makes it easy, quick, and secure for Programmers to
provide protected content to valid customers:

User Entitlement Mediated by Adobe Primetime authentication

Adobe Primetime authentication acts as your proxy in exchanges with
participating MVPDs, so you can present your viewers with a consistent
cross-site interface. Adobe Primetime authentication also allows you to
provide your viewers with single-sign-on (SSO) authentication and
authorization. Authentication and authorization are tracked for all
participating services, so that a subscriber does not need to log in
again after their first authentication on their own system.

### <span style="font-size: 18px; "><span id="HowItWorks"></span>How Adobe Primetime Authentication Works</span>

The Programmer's content-viewing application interacts with Adobe
Primetime authentication using either the Access Enabler client
component or the RESTful web services of the Clientless API (for non-web
capable devices such as smart TVs, game consoles, set-top boxes, etc.).
The Access Enabler runs on the user's system, where it facilitates all
entitlement workflows.  The Access Enabler component is downloaded from
its hosting site at Adobe when customers access your site and request
protected content.  Adobe Primetime authentication servers host the
RESTful web services used in the Clientless solution.  

 

Adobe Primetime authentication handles the actual entitlement workflows
while providing primitives you use to:

  - Set your identity.  (The Programmer is the "requestor" in the Adobe
    Primetime authentication entitlement flow.)

  - Authenticate a user with a particular MVPD.  (The MVPD is the
    "identity provider" or "IdP" in the Adobe Primetime authentication
    entitlement flow.)

  - Authorize a user with the MVPD for a particular resource.

  - Log out the user.

  
The Programmer is responsible for their upper-level web page or player
application that does the following:

  - Implements the user interface

  - Interacts with the Access Enabler or Clientless API web services

The goal of Adobe Primetime authentication is to create a simple,
modular way for both Programmers and MVPDs to handle entitlement
verification.

-----

## <span id="understanding_tokens"></span>Understanding Tokens

The Adobe Primetime authentication entitlement solution centers on the
generation of specific pieces of data that are created upon the
successful completion of the authentication and authorization workflows.
These pieces of data are called tokens. Tokens have a limited lifespan;
when they expire, tokens need to be re-issued through the re-initiation
of the authentication and authorization workflows.

 

For details on tokens, see the following sections:

  - [Types of Tokens](#Types)

  - [Token Storage](#Storage)

  - [Token Security](#security)

  - [Token Sharing](#token_sharing)

-----

### <span id="Types"></span><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; ">Types of Tokens</span>

Three types of tokens are issued during the authentication and
authorization workflows. The AuthN and AuthZ tokens are "long-lived",
providing continuity in the user's viewing experience. The Media Token
is a short-lived token that provides support for industry best practices
to prevent fraud through stream ripping. Programmers specify the
time-to-live (TTL) values for each type of token based on agreements
made with MVPDs. Programmers decide on a TTL value that best serves your
business and your customers.

 

  - **AuthN Token** ("Long-lived"): Upon successful authentication,
    Adobe Primetime authentication creates an AuthN token associated
    with both the requesting device and a globally unique identifier
    (GUID).
      - Adobe Primetime authentication sends the AuthN token to the
        Access Enabler, which caches it securely on the client's system.
         While the AuthN token is there and unexpired, it is available
        to all applications that use Adobe Primetime authentication. The
        Access Enabler uses the AuthN token for the authorization flow.
      - At any given moment only one AuthN token is cached. Whenever a
        new AuthN token is issued and an old one already exists, Adobe
        Primetime authentication overwrites the cached token.

<!-- end list -->

  - **AuthZ Token** ("Long-lived"): Upon successful authorization, Adobe
    Primetime authentication creates an AuthZ token associated with the
    requesting device and a specific protected resource.  The protected
    resource is identified by a unique resource ID.
      - Adobe Primetime authentication sends the AuthZ token to the
        Access Enabler, which caches it securely on the local system.
        The Access Enabler then uses the AuthZ token to create the
        short-lived Media token that is used for actual viewing access.
      - At any given time only one AuthZ token per resource is cached.
        Adobe Primetime authentication can cache multiple AuthZ
        tokens, as long as they are associated with different
        resources. Whenever a new AuthZ token is issued and an old one
        already exists for the same resource, Adobe Primetime
        authentication overwrites the cached token.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Media Token** ("Short-Lived"): The Access Enabler uses the AuthZ
    token to generate a short-lived (default: 7 minutes) Media token.
    This is the point at which a successful play request is considered
    to have occurred.
      - Before providing access to the protected resource, your media
        server must use an Adobe Primetime authentication component, the
        Media Token Verifier, to validate the Media token.
      - Because the Media token is not bound to the device, its
        life-span is significantly shorter (default: 7 minutes) than
        that of the long-lived AuthN and AuthZ tokens.
      - The short-lived media token is restricted to one-time use and
        is *never* cached. It is retrieved from the Adobe Primetime
        authentication server every time an authorization API is called.

 

### <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; "><span id="Storage"></span>Token Storage</span>

The Access Enabler stores long-lived tokens (AuthN and AuthZ) in
locations specific to its environment:

  - **Flash 10.1** (or higher): The long-lived tokens are stored as
    Local Shared Objects.

<!-- end list -->

  - **HTML5:** The long-lived tokens are kept securely in the HTML5
    browser's local store.

<!-- end list -->

  - **iOS:** The long-lived tokens are stored on a persistent
    pasteboard, where they can be accessed by other Adobe Primetime
    authentication client applications.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Android:** The long-lived tokens are stored in a shared database
    file, where they can be accessed by other Adobe Primetime
    authentication client applications.
  - **Clientless API devices:** Tokens are stored on the Primetime
    authentication servers.

 

### <span id="security"></span>Token Security

The Adobe Primetime authentication Server digitally signs all long-lived
tokens using the device ID (derived from device's hardware
characteristics). The digital signature differs in how it is generated,
protected, and validated depending upon the environment:

  - **Flash 10.1** (or higher) - The device ID relies on the device
    credential, a unique certificate issued from the Adobe
    Individualization server. This security is equivalent to FAXS DRM
    technology. This server-side validation compares the unique device
    ID in the token with the device credential (securely communicated
    from Flash Player to Adobe Primetime authentication). The device
    credential also identifies the FAXS client version and the Flash
    Player (or AIR) version to which it was issued. The device binding
    is stronger than with HTML5, so the time-to-live (TTL) for tokens is
    typically longer with Flash.

<!-- end list -->

  - **HTML5** - The device is individualized on the client side. It uses
    characteristics available through JavaScript to produce a
    pseudo-device ID that includes browser and OS versions, an IP
    address, and a browser cookie GUID (globally unique identifier).
    This token device ID is compared to the current pseudo-device ID for
    the device. Because the IP address can change during normal use,
    even in the same session, Adobe Primetime authentication stores
    HTML5 tokens in two locations: localStorage and sessionStorage. If
    the IP changes and the sessionStorage token is otherwise still
    valid, the session is maintained. With HTML5, the device binding is
    not as strong, so the TTL for tokens is typically shorter than for
    Flash.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Native Clients** (iOS and Android) - The long-lived tokens hold
    native device ID individualization info and thus are bound to the
    requesting device. The authentication and authorization requests are
    sent over HTTPS, and the device ID information is digitally signed
    by the Access Enabler library before sending it to the backend
    servers. On the server side, the device ID info is validated against
    its associated digital signature.
  - **Clientless API Clients** - The Clientless API solution has its set
    of security protocols that involve digitally signing all API
    calls. Tokens generated during the entitlement flows are securely
    stored on the Adobe Primetime authentication servers.

Adobe Primetime authentication validates each long-lived token to ensure
that the device accessing the content is the same as the one that issued
the token. For all tokens, a client-side validation ensures that the
digital signature is intact, and that the integrity of the token is
preserved. When device ID validation fails, the authentication session
is invalidated, and the user is prompted to log in again, which resets
the
tokens.![](https://dzf8vqv24eqhg.cloudfront.net/userfiles/258/326/ckfinder/images/import-6jvb52immo/spacer.gif)

### <span id="token_sharing"></span>Token Sharing

Applications on different platforms do not share tokens.  There are a
number of reasons for this, including the following:

  - As described in [Token Storage](#Storage), the *method* of storing
    tokens varies between platforms (e.g., Local Shared Objects for
    Flash, WebStorage for JavaScript). 
  - The degree of token security differs between platforms.  For
    example, Flash tokens are strongly bound to a device using
    FAXS. Tokens in a pure JavaScript environment do not have the same
    level of DRM support as in Flash.  Sharing JS tokens with Flash
    applications would increase the possibility of less secure tokens
    exploiting a more secure environment.

### <span id="authn_steps"></span>Authentication Steps

The following steps present an example of the Adobe Primetime
authentication authentication flow.  This is the part of the entitlement
process in which a Programmer determines if the user is a valid customer
of an MVPD.  In this scenario, the user is a valid subscriber to an
MVPD.  The user is attempting to view protected content using a
Programmer's Flash application:

1.  The user browses to the Programmer's web page, which loads the
    Programmer's Flash application and the Adobe Primetime
    authentication Access Enabler components onto the user's machine.
    The Flash application uses Access Enabler to set the Programmer's
    identify with Adobe Primetime authentication, and Adobe Primetime
    authentication primes the Access Enabler with configuration and
    state data for that Programmer (the "requestor").  The Access
    Enabler must receive this data from the server before performing any
    other API calls.  Technical note: the Programmer set its identity
    with the Access Enabler's `setRequestor()` method; for details, see
    the [Programmer Integration Guide](#).
2.  When the user tries to view the Programmer's protected content, the
    Programmer’s application presents the user with a list of MVPDs,
    from which the user selects a provider. 
3.  The user is redirected to an Adobe Primetime authentication server,
    where an
    encrypted [SAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language) request
    for the user-selected MVPD is created.  This request is sent as an
    authentication request on behalf of the Programmer to the MVPD.
    Depending on the MVPD's system, the user’s browser is then either
    redirected to the MVPD’s site to log in, or a login iFrame is
    created in the Programmer's app.  
4.  In either case (redirect or iFrame), the MVPD accepts the request
    and displays its login page.
5.  The user logs in with the MVPD, the MVPD validates the user’s status
    as a paying customer, and then the MVPD creates its own HTTP
    session.
6.  When the user is validated, the MVPD creates a response (SAML &
    encrypted), which the MVPD sends back to Adobe Primetime
    authentication.
7.  Adobe Primetime authentication receives the MVPD response, sees that
    there's an Adobe Primetime authentication HTTP session open,
    validates the SAML response from the MVPD, and redirects back to the
    Programmer's site.
8.  The Programmer's site is reloaded, the Access Enabler is reloaded,
    and the Programmer calls `setRequestor()` again.  The second call
    to `setRequestor()` is necessary because the current configuration
    has changed – there is now a flag present that informs the Access
    Enabler that an AuthN token is waiting to be generated on the
    server.
9.  The Access Enabler sees that there's a pending authentication and
    requests the token from the Adobe Primetime authentication server.
    The token is retrieved from the server by invoking the Flash
    Player’s DRM capabilities.
10. The AuthN token is stored in the Programmer’s Flash Player LSO
    cache; authentication is now complete, and the session is destroyed
    on the Adobe Primetime authentication server.

### <span id="authz_steps"></span>Authorization Steps

The following steps continue on from the [Authentication
Steps](#authn_steps):

1.  When the user tries to access the Programmer's protected content,
    the Programmer's application first checks for an AuthN token on the
    user's local machine or device.  If that token is not there, then
    the [Authentication Steps](#authn_steps) above are followed.  If the
    AuthN token *is* there, the Authorization flow proceeds with the
    Programmer's application initiating a call to the Access Enabler
    with a request to get the user's viewing rights for a specfic item
    of protected content.
2.  The specific item of protected content is represented by a "resource
    identifier".  This could be a simple string or a more complex
    structure, but in any case the nature of the resource identifier is
    agreed upon ahead of time between the Programmer and the MVPD.  The
    Programmer's application passes the resource identifier to the
    Access Enabler.  The Access Enabler checks for an AuthZ token on the
    user's local machine or device.  If the AuthZ token is not there,
    the Access Enabler passes the request to the backend Adobe Primetime
    authentication server.
3.  The Adobe Primetime authentication server communicates with the
    MVPDs authorization endpoint using standardized protocols.  If the
    MVPD's response indicates that the user is entitled to view the
    protected content, the Adobe Primetime authentication server creates
    an AuthZ token and passes it back to the Access Enabler, which
    stores the AuthZ token on the user's machine.
4.  With an AuthZ token stored on the user's machine or device, the
    Programmer's application calls the Access Enabler to obtain a Media
    Token from the Adobe Primetime authentication server and provides
    that token to the Programmer's application.
5.  Finally, the Programmer's application uses the Media Token Verifier
    component to confirm that the right user is viewing the right
    content, and with the Media Token in place, the user is allowed to
    view the protected content.

## <span id="reg_and_init"></span>Registration and Initialization

The first step in working with Adobe Primetime authentication is to
register with Adobe, or with an Adobe Primetime
authentication-authorized partner.  
 

When you register, you provide a list of the domains from which you will
communicate with Adobe Primetime authentication. For example, the Turner
Broadcasting System domains include tbs.com and tnt.tv as Adobe
Primetime authentication-registered domains. Each of these content sites
is given access to Adobe Primetime authentication, and is assigned its
own Requestor ID (for example, "TBS", and "TNT"). If you decide to add
additional sites, you must inform Adobe of the additional domain names
to get them placed on the list of allowed domains and be given
additional Requestor IDs.

<table class="noteMacro">

<tr class="odd">
<td><img src="https://dzf8vqv24eqhg.cloudfront.net/userfiles/258/326/ckfinder/images/import-xtrt5uzksi/warning.gif" width="16" height="16" /></td>
<td><p><strong>While you are testing your integration, make sure that your test server is on a registered domain that you intend to use in production. Requests, even test requests, coming from non-whitelisted domains are ignored.</strong> For example, if you requested domain.com to be used in production, make sure you are deploying your test integration under domain.com, test.domain.com, staging.domain.com, etc.</p>

Requests that contain username and / or password in the URL are ignored even if domains are whitelisted. Example: //<em>username</em>@registered-domain/</p>
<p> </p></td>

</div>

  
The Requestor ID uniquely identifies the Programmer's client in all
communications with Adobe Primetime authentication's Access Enabler
client component. All Adobe Primetime authentication static data
associated with the Programmer is keyed to this ID.

1.  [Requestor Setup](#requestor)
2.  [Handling Authentication and Authorization](#authn_authz)
3.  [Supporting Single Logout](#ssl)

###  

### <span id="requestor"></span>1. Requestor Setup

#### 1a. Registering With Adobe

Your first step is to register with Adobe, or with an Adobe Primetime
authentication authorized partner.  When you register you are issued one
or more globally unique identifiers (GUIDs). Each GUID you are issued is
associated with a domain from which access is allowed to Adobe Primetime
authentication. You pass a GUID (called the *requestor ID)* for the
requesting domain to register your identity for each session in which
you interact with the Access Enabler. For details, see [Registration &
Initialization](#) in the Programmer Integration Guide.  
 

#### 1b. Initial Access Enabler Integration

The next step is to integrate the Access Enabler into your existing
media player app or web page:

  - You can embed the Flash version, `AccessEnabler.swf`, in a
    Flash-based video player, or you can embed it directly in your web
    page's HTML. You can communicate with the Access Enabler SWF in
    either ActionScript or JavaScript. The base API is ActionScript, but
    if you prefer to work with JavaScript, a complete wrapper library is
    available for inclusion on your pages.

<!-- end list -->

  - For non-Flash environments, you can:
      - Use the HTML5/JavaScript version, `AccessEnabler.js`, and
        communicate with it through the JavaScript API
      - Use the AIR Native Extension for Adobe Primetime
        authentication to combine native code with built-in
        ActionScript classes
      - Use one of the native client versions of the Access Enabler
        library (iOS or Android)

 

### <span id="authn_authz"></span>2. Handling Authentication and Authorization

#### 2a. Communicating with the Access Enabler

Communication between the Access Enabler and your web page or player app
is asynchronous. Your application calls Access Enabler methods, and the
Access Enabler responds via callbacks that you register with the Access
Enabler library.

  - When your application makes an *authorization* request, the Access
    Enabler automatically initiates an *authentication* request, if a
    valid AuthN token is not already on the local system. When
    authentication succeeds, the user's AuthN token is stored locally,
    so that they do not need to log in again. If they have successfully
    authenticated through Adobe Primetime authentication in any other
    context (for example, through the MVPD website or with a different
    Programmer), the Access Enabler has access to the local AuthN token
    and an additional authentication is not needed.

<!-- end list -->

  - When a user attempts to access your protected content, you send an
    authorization request to the Access Enabler. After verifying (or
    initiating) authentication, the Access Enabler contacts the MVPD
    (via the Adobe Primetime authentication server) to determine whether
    the customer is entitled to view the protected content. Your
    application only needs to send the request to the Access Enabler,
    and then handle the response (authorization success or failure). If
    authorization succeeds, an AuthZ token is stored on the client
    system.  Finally, your application receives a short-lived Media
    token for use in your own authorization procedure.

</ul></td>

</tbody>

#### <span id="entitlement_ui"></span>2b. Providing An Entitlement User Interface

You provide your own UI for user access to your content. Some elements,
such as the actual login process, are provided by the MVPD, and some
elements are optionally available as part of Adobe Primetime
authentication. At minimum, you do the following:

  - **Implement an MVPD selection interface that allows a new user to
    identify their MVPD and log in for the first time.** For
    development, the Access Enabler provides a basic user interface that
    gives the customer a choice of MVPDs and initiates the login
    process. For production, you must implement your own MVPD Selector
    dialog. Some MVPDs redirect to their own site for login, and some
    require their login pages to be displayed within an iFrame. You must
    implement a callback that creates this iFrame to handle the cases
    where the user's MVPD displays their login page in an iFrame.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Identify protected content.** Protected content requires
    authorization to access. Your interface should indicate which
    content is protected, and which content has been authorized.
     Authorization status is often indicated with "unlocked" and
    "locked" icons.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Show that a user is authenticated.** You should indicate a user's
    authentication status as part of whatever means you use to identify
    protected content. You can query the Access Enabler to determine
    whether the customer has already been authenticated.

####   
2c. Integrating the Media Token Verifier

You must integrate the Adobe Primetime authentication Media Token
Verifier component into your media server.  This is so your existing
token verifier can recognize the short-lived Media tokens provided from
Adobe Primetime authentication with a successful authorization. The
Media Token Verifier validates the Media tokens as the last security
step before you provide the user access to protected content. You

### <span id="ssl"></span>3. Supporting Single Logout

In most cases, your media player is responsible for handling user
logouts via a simple Access Enabler API. When you call `logout()`, the
Access Enabler does the following:

  - Logs out the current user
  - Clears all authentication and authorization information for the
    logged out user
  - Deletes all AuthN and AuthZ tokens from the user's local system

If the user leaves their machine idle long enough for their tokens to
expire, the user can still return to the session and successfully
initiate logout. Adobe Primetime authentication ensures that all tokens
are deleted, and notifies the MVPD to delete their session as well.  
 

When the logout is initiated from a site that isn’t integrated with
Adobe Primetime authentication, the MVPD can invoke the Adobe Primetime
authentication Single Logout service through a browser redirect.

## <span id="user_ids"></span>Understanding User IDs

Conceptually, each user who initiates an entitlement flow is associated
with a single, unique user ID.  However, through the course of an
entitlement flow, that one user ID can be presented in different ways,
depending upon which API you obtain the ID from.

 

The `sessionGUID` in the Short Media Token is the secure form of the
UserID, which is available via the `sendTrackingData()` call.   In all
current integrations, this is a persistent GUID for the user across time
and devices, but the source of the GUID starts with the UserID in the
SAML response from the MVPD.   However, some MVPDs could change their
mind in the future, and start sending a transient GUID.  If a Programmer
wants to ensure that the MVPD source UserID in the AuthN response is
persistent, they should arrange for that in their agreements with MVPDs.
   
  
Here are the different ways the User ID is represented in the Adobe
Primetime authentication APIs:

  - `sendTrackingData()` `GUID` property - This is the Adobe hashed
    version of the MVPD UserID.  It is hashed so this User ID is not
    trackable back to the source from the MVPD.   This ID is unique and
    typically persistent, but it can't be shared with the MVPD to
    compare specific usage behavior with what MVPDs have on their side.
      It is not digitally signed, so not unspoofable for fraud
    prevention, but it *is* good enough for analytics.  This form of the
    User ID is provided client-side on all of the events that Adobe
    Primetime authentication generates in the AuthN/AuthZ flow. 
  - Short Media Token's `sessionGUID` property - This is the same as the
    UserID via `sendTrackingData()`, however, this one is digitally
    signed to protect its integrity.  That makes this value good enough
    for fraud tracking of concurrent usage.    It is intended to be
    processed on the server side after using our validator library, and
    can be analyzed for fraud patterns before releasing the video stream
    to the client.  Doing any of these tasks is up to the Programmer.  
  - `getMetadata() userID` property - This property will allow Adobe to
    expose the actual source MVPD UserID to the Programmer.  It will be
    encrypted with the public key from the certificate we have from the
    Programmer, so that it is not exposed in the clear to the client.
     This gives the Programmer the actual UserID from the MVPD, so it
    is something that can be used for account linking or fraud
    investigation directly with the MVPD.    
     

**In conclusion**

  - The MVPD User ID is a generally, though not guaranteed, persistent
    unique ID that is <u>generated from the MVPDs and passed to Adobe on
    successful authentication</u>. It is generally consistent across all
    networks with some exceptions.

  - The MVPD User ID does not contain PII and it is NOT an account
    number. It does not need to be exposed in an encrypted form since we
    have validated with all the MVPDs that no PII is being sent.   

  
How you use the user ID depends on the use case:

  - If you need it for tracking/analytics, the most practical place is
    to get it from `sendTrackingData()`.
  - If you need it on the server-side for stream release, fraud, or
    operational data, you can get it from the Media Token Validator.
  - If you need it for account linking and deeper fraud, check with your
    Adobe contact for availability.
