# Integrate your ad server {#integrate-ad-server}

To start, you will be given a login to access the Primetime Ad Insertion console, where you will set up rules that Primetime Ad Insertion uses to forward ad requests to the ad server of your choice. Primetime Ad Insertion supports most VAST or VMAP compliant ad servers.

## Macro support {#macro-support}

Primetime Ad Insertion enables the following ad server macros for all streams:

* Cache-busting
* Application context or page url
* Avail duration
* Current video asset

If additional macros are needed, contact your Adobe Primetime Support representative.

## Advanced Features {#advanced-features}

Primetime Ad Insertion also features rules-based decisioning that enables advanced features. This can be important if you want to route ads to different ad servers based on inventory rights or enable frequency capping for individual ads. For more information, see [Advanced Features](/help/primetime-ad-insertion/advanced-features/route-ads-based-on-rules.md).
