# Using Just-in-Time Transcoding to Inject ID3 Timed Metadata Tags {#using-crs-to-inject-id-timed-metadata-tags}

CRS can inject ID3 timed metadata into ad creatives to facilitate client-side ad tracking.

The client player reads the ID3 metadata to enable frame-accurate ad tracking.

>ID3 timed metadata injection functions only for Safari/iOS.
