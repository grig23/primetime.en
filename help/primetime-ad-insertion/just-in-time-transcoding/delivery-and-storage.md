# Delivery and storage {#delivery-and-storage}

Primetime Ad Insertion supports ad creative storage on either customer CDNs or Adobe-hosted CDNs.

## Multi-CDN support {#multi-cdn-support}

Primetime Ad Insertion by default serves transcoded ad creatives from Adobe-hosted CDNs (Akamai).  Customers can choose additional CDN locations to host the transcoded asset, or use the Adobe-hosted CDN as an origin for their own CDNs.  Both of these cases allow for content and ad creatives to be served from the same CDN and/or hostname.

For Multi-CDN delivery, using Primetime Ad Insertion as a CDN origin, please refer to: [Manifest Rewriting](../technical-reference/manifest-rewriting.md)

To enable Multi-CDN storage/uploading, please contact your technical account manager.
