# Optimize Ad experiences {#optimizing-ad-experiences}

While deciding which ad to serve a viewer is the domain of the ad server, Primetime Ad Insertion also features an advanced ad decisioning engine that can optimize the overall ad experience for each viewer. For instance, ad loads could be reduced for viewers who are deemed to have a high lifetime value or who have been binge-watching for over 3 hours.

In situations where ad loads have not been predefined--for example, in VOD programming--customers can use Primetime Ad Insertion to customize viewer ad loads based on information about the viewer, their viewing session, the content or other factors.

The ad load settings can be configured in the Session Ad Rules section (under the Administration tab) of the Primetime Ad Insertion console.
