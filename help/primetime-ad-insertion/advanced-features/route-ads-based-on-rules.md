# Routing Ads Based on Rules {#routing-ads-based-on-rules}

Primetime Ad Insertion supports the ability to redirect ad requests to one or more ad servers using content metadata, audience targeting data or other parameters. This could be important for use cases where inventory rights are shared between multiple parties, such as a TV network and cable/satellite operator. Use the Targeted Ad Redirection and Partner / Sales Rights sections of the Primetime Ad Insertion console to set up these rules. Please contact your Primetime support representative for more information.
