# Analyze performance {#analyze-performnce}

The Primetime Ad Insertion console offers dashboards to analyze request and ad performance of individual sessions or streams. For more information, see [Performance monitoring](/help/primetime-ad-insertion/performance-monitoring-debugging-reporting/performance-monitoring.md) and [Reporting and billing](/help/primetime-ad-insertion/performance-monitoring-debugging-reporting/reporting-and-billing.md).

## Analyze individual timings of a request {#analyze-timings}

Timings for both CDN and ad resolution can be inspected using headers that are sent with every request.  For more information, see [Debugging Headers](/help/primetime-ad-insertion/performance-monitoring-debugging-reporting/debugging-headers.md).
