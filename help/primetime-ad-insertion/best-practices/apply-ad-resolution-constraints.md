# Apply Ad Resolution Constraints {#apply-ad-resolution-constraints}

There may be cases where particular ad providers are slow to respond, which can cause video start-up times to increase. Primetime Ad Insertion supports timeouts of ad requests and the entire ad resolution phase to limit the impact of these slow ad providers.  Fallback ads can also be inserted if downstream ad providers are too slow to respond.  For more information, see [`ptadtimeout` parameter in Bootstrap API](/help/primetime-ad-insertion/technical-reference/bootstrap-api.md).
