# Report API {#report-api}

User Interface has managed roles for customers and for the enablement (Adobe) team. Customers can access the portal, and can then create and edit their configurations. They can also see the reports for their ads impressions on the user interface.

APIs work behind the scenes to facilitate customers and administrators in communicating with the backend infrastructure.

See the report API documentation in [Report APIs for Auditude](../assets/auditude-report-api.pdf).
