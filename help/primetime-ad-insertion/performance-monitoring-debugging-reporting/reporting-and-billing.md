# Reporting and Billing {#reporting-and-billing}

The Primetime Ad Insertion console includes a Reporting and a Billing module to give you all the tools you need to determine the health of your ad insertion business. The Reporting module enables you to run impression reports across many dimensions on a time bound basis. Reports can be run on an ad-hoc basis and/or set up for scheduled delivery to specific email addresses. The Billing report enables you to prepare custom reports to your clients or partners that can be used for billing operations such as charging for ad insertion.
