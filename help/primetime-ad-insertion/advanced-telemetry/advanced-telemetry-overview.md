# Advanced Telemetry {#advanced-telemetry}

Customers have the ability to use Primetime Ad Insertion to capture ad and session related events and metrics to uncover the key causes of both content and ad errors to get insights into video and ad performance.  Ad requests can be captured at the raw request level, giving operators the ability to debug specific VAST or VMAP tags coming directly from providers.
